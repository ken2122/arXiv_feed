In this work, ADLAH is introduced: an Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet designed to maximize high-fidelity threat intelligence while minimizing cost through autonomous orchestration of infrastructure. The principal contribution is offered as an end-to-end architectural blueprint and vision for an AI-driven deception platform. Feasibility is evidenced by a functional prototype of the central decision mechanism, in which a reinforcement learning (RL) agent determines, in real time, when sessions should be escalated from low-interaction sensor nodes to dynamically provisioned, high-interaction honeypots. Because sufficient live data were unavailable, field-scale validation is not claimed; instead, design trade-offs and limitations are detailed, and a rigorous roadmap toward empirical evaluation at scale is provided. Beyond selective escalation and anomaly detection, the architecture pursues automated extraction, clustering, and versioning of bot attack chains, a core capability motivated by the empirical observation that exposed services are dominated by automated traffic. Together, these elements delineate a practical path toward cost-efficient capture of high-value adversary behavior, systematic bot versioning, and the production of actionable threat intelligence.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07827v1\n    "}}

Prior work shows that commercial models can reproduce sensitive PII, yet existing studies largely treat PII as a single category and overlook the heterogeneous risks among different types. We investigate whether distinct PII types vary in their likelihood of being learned and leaked by LLM4Code, and whether this relationship is causal. Our methodology includes building a dataset with diverse PII types, fine-tuning representative models of different scales, computing training dynamics on real PII data, and formulating a structural causal model to estimate the causal effect of learnability on leakage. Results show that leakage risks differ substantially across PII types and correlate with their training dynamics: easy-to-learn instances such as IP addresses exhibit higher leakage, while harder types such as keys and passwords leak less frequently. Ambiguous types show mixed behaviors. This work provides the first causal evidence that leakage risks are type-dependent and offers guidance for developing type-aware and learnability-aware defenses for LLM4Code.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07814v1\n    "}}

Most schedulers treat workloads as single monolithic tasks, ignoring that many jobs, like video encoding or offline inference, consist of smaller tasks with specific dependencies and resource needs; however, knowledge of this structure enables opportunities for greater carbon efficiency.\n  We quantify the maximum benefit of a dependency-aware approach for batch workloads. We model the problem as a flexible job-shop scheduling variant and use an offline solver to compute upper bounds on carbon and energy savings. Results show up to $25\\%$ lower carbon emissions on average without increasing the optimal makespan (total job completion time) compared to a makespan-only baseline. Although in heterogeneous server setup, these schedules may use more energy than energy-optimal ones. Our results also show that allowing twice the optimal makespan nearly doubles the carbon savings, underscoring the tension between carbon, energy, and makespan. We also highlight key factors such as job structure and server count influence the achievable carbon reductions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07799v1\n    "}}

At Meta, it's used across the company for various tasks such as deriving product insights, providing and improving user services, and enabling AI at scale for our ever-growing user base. Meta's current stream processing framework supports processing TerraBytes(TBs) of data in mere seconds. This is enabled by our efficient schedulers and multi-layered infrastructure, which allocate workloads across various compute resources, working together in hierarchies across various parts of the infrastructure. But with the ever growing complexity of applications, and user needs, areas of the infrastructure that previously required minimal load balancing, now must be made more robust and proactive to application load. In our work we explore how to build and design such a system that focuses on load balancing over key compute resources and properties of these applications. We also showcase how to integrate new schedulers into the hierarchy of the existing ones, allowing multiple schedulers to work together and perform load balancing, at their infrastructure level, effectively.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07792v1\n    "}}

Here, we theoretically propose and demonstrate a scheme for generating non-Gaussian mechanical states using a strongly driven hybrid system that combines cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and cavity optomechanics. Our protocol prepares a non-Gaussian cavity state in the dispersive regime of cavity QED and subsequently transfers it to a mechanical oscillator using the optomechanical interaction enhanced by a coherent cavity drive. While non-Gaussian cavity state control in cavity QED is well established in the dispersive regime, its behavior under strong cavity drive, essential for cavity optomechanics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we develop an efficient simulation framework to model cavity QED dynamics in the high-photon-number regime. We show that a strong cavity drive can coherently displace the cavity state with minimal perturbations, effectively decoupling it from the qubit. The resulting large coherent cavity field enhances the optomechanical coupling strength, enabling high-fidelity transfer of non-Gaussian cavity states to the mechanical mode. These results reveal new dynamical features of driven cavity QED and open a pathway toward realizing non-Gaussian mechanical quantum memories and sensors.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07788v1\n    "}}

We assess whether quantum algorithms can surpass classical computational limits by generating detailed quantum resource estimates (QREs) in terms of logical qubits and $T$-gate counts. Our analysis is based on a quantum algorithm leveraging Carleman linearization of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which has been suggested to offer exponential speedup. We develop efficient block encodings for LBM matrices and a method for amplitude-encoding drag force. We apply the method to the simple case of fluid flow past a sphere across a range of Reynolds numbers ($\\mathrm{Re}$). We estimate the required (logical qubits)$\\times$($T$-gates), finding them to be prohibitively large, ranging from $10^{21}$ to $10^{39}$. While classical simulations scale as $O(\\mathrm{Re}^3)$, our QREs exhibit a modest polynomial scaling of $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{2.68})$, indicating no exponential quantum advantage. We attribute this limitation to an intrinsic power-law relationship between spatial grid resolution and time-stepping requirements that is a fundamental characteristic of explicit methods for evolving nonlinear differential equations. Thus, quantum computers are unlikely to provide utility in applications that require time-evolving fluids and other systems of nonlinear differential equations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06323v3\n    "}}

Over time, various enhancements have been introduced to strengthen the integrity of DNS. Among these, DNSSEC stands out as a leading cryptographic solution. It protects against attacks (such as DNS spoofing) by establishing a chain of trust throughout the DNS nameserver hierarchy. However, DNSSEC's effectiveness is compromised when there is a break in this chain, resulting in \"Islands of Security\", where domains can authenticate locally but not across hierarchical levels, leading to a loss of trust and validation between them. Leading approaches to addressing these issues were centralized, with a single authority maintaining some kind of bulletin board. This approach requires significantly more infrastructure and places excessive trust in the entity responsible for managing it properly. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach to addressing gaps in DNSSEC's chain of trust, commonly referred to as \"Islands of Security\". We leverage TLS and IP-based certificates to enable end-to-end authentication between hierarchical levels, eliminating the need for uniform DNSSEC deployment across every level of the DNS hierarchy.

But operators do not have tools to help them understand how each model and the interaction between them affect the end-to-end system performance. SANJESH is such a tool. SANJESH supports a diverse set of performance-related queries which we answer through a bi-level optimization. We invent novel mechanisms to solve this optimization more quickly. These techniques allow us to solve an optimization which prior work failed to solve even after $24$ hours.\n  As a proof of concept, we apply SANJESH to an example production system that uses multiple ML models to optimize virtual machine (VM) placement. These models impact how many servers the operators uses to host VMs and the frequency with which it has to live-migrate them because the servers run out of resources. SANJESH finds scenarios where these models cause $~4\\times$ worse performance than what simulation-based approaches detect.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07750v1\n    "}}

However, this reuse of prior designs also leads to similar vulnerabilities across multiple processors. As processors grow increasingly complex with iterative modifications, efficiently detecting vulnerabilities from modern processors is critical. Inspired by software fuzzing, hardware fuzzing has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting processor vulnerabilities. Yet, to our best knowledge, existing processor fuzzers fuzz each design individually, lacking the capability to understand known vulnerabilities in prior processors to fine-tune fuzzing to identify similar or new variants of vulnerabilities.\n  To address this gap, we present ReFuzz, an adaptive fuzzing framework that leverages contextual bandit to reuse highly effective tests from prior processors to fuzz a processor-under-test (PUT) within a given ISA. By intelligently mutating tests that trigger vulnerabilities in prior processors, ReFuzz effectively detects similar and new variants of vulnerabilities in PUTs. ReFuzz uncovered three new security vulnerabilities and two new functional bugs. ReFuzz detected one vulnerability by reusing a test that triggers a known vulnerability in a prior processor. One functional bug exists across three processors that share design modules. The second bug has two variants. Additionally, ReFuzz reuses highly effective tests to enhance efficiency in coverage, achieving an average 511.23x coverage speedup and up to 9.33% more total coverage, compared to existing fuzzers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04436v2\n    "}}

With respect to such networks, it is paramount to be able to determine what performance level the network segment can guarantee at a given point in time. One promising approach is to use predictive models trained using machine learning (ML). Predicting performance metrics such as one-way delay (OWD), in a timely manner, provides valuable insights for the network, user equipments (UEs), and applications to address performance trends, deviations, and violations. Over the course of time, a dynamic network environment results in distributional shifts, which causes catastrophic forgetting and drop of ML model performance. In continual learning (CL), the model aims to achieve a balance between stability and plasticity, enabling new information to be learned while preserving previously learned knowledge. In this paper, we target on the challenges of catastrophic forgetting of OWD prediction model. We propose a novel approach which introducing the concept of multi-generator for the state-of-the-art CL generative replay framework, along with tabular variational autoencoders (TVAE) as generators. The domain knowledge of UE capabilities is incorporated into the learning process for determining generator setup and relevance. The proposed approach is evaluated across a diverse set of scenarios with data that is collected in a realistic 5G testbed, demonstrating its outstanding performance in comparison to baselines.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07726v1\n    "}}

Browser agents are software that automate Web browsing using large language models and ancillary tooling. However, the automated capabilities that make browser agents powerful also make them high-risk points of failure. Both the kinds of tasks browser agents are designed to execute, along with the kinds of information browser agents are entrusted with to fulfill those tasks, mean that vulnerabilities in these tools can result in enormous privacy harm.\n  This work presents a framework of five broad factors (totaling 15 distinct measurements) to measure the privacy risks in browser agents. Our framework assesses i. vulnerabilities in the browser agent's components, ii. how the browser agent protects against website behaviors, iii. whether the browser agent prevents cross-site tracking, iv. how the agent responds to privacy-affecting prompts, and v. whether the tool leaks personal information to sites. We apply our framework to eight browser agents and identify 30 vulnerabilities, ranging from disabled browser privacy features to \"autocompleting\" sensitive personal information in form fields. We have responsibly disclosed our findings, and plan to release our dataset and other artifacts.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07725v1\n    "}}

After all computations are performed on the encrypted data, it can be decrypted to reveal the result. The decrypted value matches the result that would have been obtained if the same computations were applied to the plaintext data.\n  FHE supports basic operations such as addition and multiplication on encrypted numbers. Using these fundamental operations, more complex computations can be constructed, including subtraction, division, logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, NAND, MUX), and even advanced mathematical functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and trigonometric functions (e.g., sin, cos). These functions can be implemented either as exact formulas or as approximations, depending on the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy.\n  FHE enables privacy-preserving machine learning by allowing a server to process the client's data in its encrypted form through an ML model. With FHE, the server learns neither the plaintext version of the input features nor the inference results. Only the client, using their secret key, can decrypt and access the results at the end of the service protocol. FHE can also be applied to confidential blockchain services, ensuring that sensitive data in smart contracts remains encrypted and confidential while maintaining the transparency and integrity of the execution process. Other applications of FHE include secure outsourcing of data analytics, encrypted database queries, privacy-preserving searches, efficient multi-party computation for digital signatures, and more.\n  This book is an open project (https://fhetextbook.github.io), please report any bugs or errors to the Github issues board.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05136v21\n    "}}

While prior work has evaluated language models on data-sharing scenarios based on general privacy norms, we focus on personalizing language models' privacy decisions, grounding their judgments directly in prior user privacy decisions. Our findings suggest that general privacy norms are insufficient for effective personalization of privacy decisions. Furthermore, we find that eliciting privacy judgments from the model through In-context Learning (ICL) is unreliable to due misalignment with the user's prior privacy judgments and opaque reasoning traces, which make it difficult for the user to interpret the reasoning behind the model's decisions. To address these limitations, we propose ARIEL (Agentic Reasoning with Individualized Entailment Logic), a framework that jointly leverages a language model and rule-based logic for structured data-sharing reasoning. ARIEL is based on formulating personalization of data sharing as an entailment, whether a prior user judgment on a data-sharing request implies the same judgment for an incoming request. Our experimental evaluations on advanced models and publicly-available datasets demonstrate that ARIEL can reduce the F1 score error by $\\textbf{39.1%}$ over language model-based reasoning (ICL), demonstrating that ARIEL is effective at correctly judging requests where the user would approve data sharing. Overall, our findings suggest that combining LLMs with strict logical entailment is a highly effective strategy for enabling personalized privacy judgments for agents.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05065v2\n    "}}

DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11560v5\n    "}}

However, ML-based detectors are vulnerable to evasion attacks, where small, crafted changes bypass detection. Despite progress in adversarial defenses, the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks in binary-constrained domains limits understanding of their robustness. We introduce two key contributions. First, Prioritized Binary Rounding, a technique to convert continuous perturbations into binary feature spaces while preserving high attack success and low perturbation size. Second, the sigma-binary attack, a novel adversarial method for binary domains, designed to achieve attack goals with minimal feature changes. Experiments on the Malscan dataset show that sigma-binary outperforms existing attacks and exposes key vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art defenses. Defenses equipped with adversary detectors, such as KDE, DLA, DNN+, and ICNN, exhibit significant brittleness, with attack success rates exceeding 90% using fewer than 10 feature modifications and reaching 100% with just 20. Adversarially trained defenses, including AT-rFGSM-k, AT-MaxMA, improves robustness under small budgets but remains vulnerable to unrestricted perturbations, with attack success rates of 99.45% and 96.62%, respectively. Although PAD-SMA demonstrates strong robustness against state-of-the-art gradient-based adversarial attacks by maintaining an attack success rate below 16.55%, the sigma-binary attack significantly outperforms these methods, achieving a 94.56% success rate under unrestricted perturbations. These findings highlight the critical need for precise method like sigma-binary to expose hidden vulnerabilities in existing defenses and support the development of more resilient malware detection systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09342v2\n    "}}

This study reveals that unlike conventional intra-band SC for which disorder has a dramatic impact, that associated with FBs is surprisingly robust to disorder-induced fluctuations and quasi-particle localization. In particular, for weak off-diagonal disorder, the critical temperature decreases linearly with disorder amplitude for conventional SC, whereas it is only quadratic in the case of SC in FBs. Our findings could have a major impact on the research and development of new compounds whose high purity will no longer be a critical barrier to their synthesis.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07648v1\n    "}}

As use-case diversity grows exponentially and user adoption drives traffic to unprecedented and highly dynamic levels, novel service orchestration mechanisms are indispensable. In this paper, we adopt an architectural viewpoint, examining Service Registration, Indexing, Discovery, and Selection (SRIDS) as fundamental elements of 6G service provision. We first establish the theoretical foundations of SRIDS in 6G by defining its core concepts, detailing its end-to-end workflow, reviewing current standardization efforts, and projecting its future design objectives, including reliability, scalability, automaticity and adaptability, determinism, efficiency, sustainability, semantic-awareness, security, privacy, and trust. We then perform a comprehensive literature review and gap analysis encompassing both existing surveys and recent research efforts, identifying conceptual and methodological gaps that hinder unified SRIDS in 6G. Next, we introduce a taxonomy that classifies SRIDS mechanisms into centralized, distributed, decentralized, and hybrid architectures, and systematically examine the relevant studies within each category. Each work is evaluated against the extracted design objectives. Building on these findings, we propose a hybrid architectural framework, combining centralized data management to ensure consistency and agility with distributed coordination to enhance scalability in emerging 6G use cases. The framework incorporates innovative technologies, such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). We conclude by highlighting open challenges and suggesting directions for future research.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07638v1\n    "}}

In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21137v3\n    "}}

Their internals include a battery management system (BMS), a radio interface, and a motor controller. Despite their associated risk, there is little research on BES internal attack surfaces. To fill this gap, we present the first security and privacy assessment of e-scooters internals. We cover Xiaomi M365 (2016) and ES3 (2023) e-scooters and their interactions with Mi Home (their companion app). We extensively RE their internals and uncover four critical design vulnerabilities, including a remote code execution issue with their BMS. Based on our RE findings, we develop E-Trojans, four novel attacks targeting BES internals. The attacks can be conducted remotely or in wireless proximity. They have a widespread real-world impact as they violate the Xiaomi e-scooter ecosystem safety, security, availability, and privacy. For instance, one attack allows the extortion of money from a victim via a BMS undervoltage battery ransomware. A second one enables user tracking by fingerprinting the BES internals. With extra RE efforts, the attacks can be ported to other BES featuring similar vulnerabilities. We implement our attacks and RE findings in E-Trojans, a modular and low-cost toolkit to test BES internals. Our toolkit binary patches BMS firmware by adding malicious capabilities. It also implements our undervoltage battery ransomware in an Android app with a working backend. We successfully test our four attacks on M365 and ES3, empirically confirming their effectiveness and practicality. We propose four practical countermeasures to fix our attacks and improve the Xiaomi e-scooter ecosystem security and privacy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17184v3\n    "}}

Here we introduce a tensor-network formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method based on matrix product states (MPS), commonly known as a quantum-inspired approach, enabling compressed representations of structured flow fields with inherent error control. We demonstrate the generality of the method on flows through structured media and complex vascular geometries, establishing for the first time that tensor-network techniques can efficiently resolve fluid dynamics in complex, irregular domains. We show that in the presence of translational or approximate symmetries of the geometry, fluid states exhibit low effective complexity in MPS form, yielding compression ratios exceeding two orders of magnitude while preserving physical structure and dynamical fidelity. This reduction enables systematic numerical exploration of regimes that were previously intractable. Our results position tensor networks as a scalable paradigm for continuum mechanics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07615v1\n    "}}

It is specified in an open standard, including the WebAuthn and CTAP application layer protocols. We focus on CTAP, which allows FIDO2 clients and hardware authenticators to communicate. No prior work has explored the CTAP Authenticator API, a critical protocol-level attack surface. We address this gap by presenting the first security and privacy evaluation of the CTAP Authenticator API. We uncover two classes of protocol-level attacks on CTAP that we call CTRAPS. The client impersonation (CI) attacks exploit the lack of client authentication to tamper with FIDO2 authenticators. They include zero-click attacks capable of deleting FIDO2 credentials, including passkeys, without user interaction. The API confusion (AC) attacks abuse the lack of protocol API enforcements and confound FIDO2 authenticators, clients, and unaware users into calling unwanted CTAP APIs while thinking they are calling legitimate ones. The presented eleven attacks are conducted either in proximity or remotely and are effective regardless of the underlying CTAP transport. We detail the eight vulnerabilities in the CTAP specification, enabling the CTRAPS attacks. Six are novel and include unauthenticated CTAP clients and trackable FIDO2 credentials. We release CTRAPS, an original toolkit, to analyze CTAP and conduct the CTRAPS attacks. We confirm the attacks practicality on a large scale by exploiting six popular authenticators, including a FIPS-certified one from Yubico, Feitian, SoloKeys, and Google, and ten widely used relying parties, such as Microsoft, Apple, GitHub, and Facebook. We present eight practical and backward-compliant countermeasures to fix the attacks and their root causes. We responsibly disclosed our findings to the FIDO alliance and the affected vendors.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02349v2\n    "}}

While most adhere to open-source licenses, some falsely claim original training despite clear derivation from public models, raising pressing concerns about intellectual property protection and the need to verify model provenance. In this paper, we propose GhostSpec, a lightweight yet effective method for verifying LLM lineage without access to training data or modification of model behavior. Our approach constructs compact and robust fingerprints by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to invariant products of internal attention weight matrices. Unlike watermarking or output-based methods, GhostSpec is fully data-free, non-invasive, and computationally efficient. Extensive experiments show it is robust to fine-tuning, pruning, expansion, and adversarial transformations, reliably tracing lineage with minimal overhead. By offering a practical solution for model verification, our method contributes to intellectual property protection and fosters a transparent, trustworthy LLM ecosystem.

Automatic segmentation is complicated by low lesion-parenchyma contrast, blurred or incomplete boundaries, heterogeneous enhancement patterns, and confounding structures such as vessels and adjacent organs. We propose a hybrid framework that couples an attention-enhanced cascaded U-Net with handcrafted radiomics and voxel-wise 3D CNN refinement for joint liver and liver-tumor segmentation. First, a 2.5D two-stage network with a densely connected encoder, sub-pixel convolution decoders and multi-scale attention gates produces initial liver and tumor probability maps from short stacks of axial slices. Inter-slice temporal consistency is then enforced by a simple three-slice refinement rule along the cranio-caudal direction, which restores thin and tiny lesions while suppressing isolated noise. Next, 728 radiomic descriptors spanning intensity, texture, shape, boundary and wavelet feature groups are extracted from candidate lesions and reduced to 20 stable, highly informative features via multi-strategy feature selection; a random forest classifier uses these features to reject false-positive regions. Finally, a compact 3D patch-based CNN derived from AlexNet operates in a narrow band around the tumor boundary to perform voxel-level relabelling and contour smoothing.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07574v1\n    "}}

However, the security implications of using LLMs for code translation remain largely unexplored, as existing evaluations primarily focus on syntactic and functional correctness. To bridge this gap, we conduct a security-centric empirical study to investigate the risks of vulnerabilities being introduced or preserved during LLM-based translation. Our study involves a rigorous evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated dataset of 720 security-related code samples across four programming languages (Java, PHP, C, C++) and nine Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. The results reveal significant security degradation, with 28.6\\% to 45\\% of translations introducing new vulnerabilities. Web-related flaws, particularly in input validation, proved most challenging for LLMs. Furthermore, we identify and categorize the root causes of these vulnerable translations into a taxonomy of five major error types.

The relative motion between the system and the bath breaks detailed balance, preventing thermalization to a Gibbs state. We find that the resulting steady-states fall into two distinct classes: (i) NESSs with persistent probability currents, and (ii) current-free non-Gibbs steady states characterized by a frequency-dependent effective inverse temperature. We demonstrate, using a three-level system, that NESSs with probability current can function as noisy stochastic clock, while current-free non-Gibbs steady states possess non-zero non-equilibrium free energy, indicating their potential as a quantum battery for work extraction or storage.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07567v1\n    "}}

We present a class of unitary transformations based on permutation matrices that, acting on the initial state of the system, (i) suppress the contribution of slowest decaying modes of the nonunitary dynamics; (ii) ensure that it is as distinguishable as possible from the steady state. The first requirement guarantees an exponentially accelerating convergence to the steady state, while the second implies that a quantum system initially farther from equilibrium approaches it more rapidly than an initial state closer to it. This protocol provides a genuine Mpemba effect, and its numerical simulation requires low computational effort. We prove that, for any initial state, there always exists a permutation matrix that maximizes its distance from the equilibrium for a given information-theoretic distinguishability measure. We illustrate our findings for the nonunitary dynamics of the transverse field Ising chain and XXZ chain, each weakly coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, showing the quantum Mpemba effect captured by the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, quantum relative entropy, and trace distance. Our results provide a universal and versatile framework to engineer the genuine quantum Mpemba effect in open quantum systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07561v1\n    "}}

However, most existing studies do not account for bandwidth limitations in network topology design. In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-aware network topology optimization framework to maximize consensus speed under edge cardinality constraints. For heterogeneous bandwidth scenarios, we introduce a maximum bandwidth allocation strategy for the edges to ensure efficient communication among nodes. By reformulating the problem into an equivalent Mixed-Integer SDP problem, we leverage a computationally efficient ADMM-based method to obtain topologies that yield the maximum consensus speed. Within the ADMM substep, we adopt the conjugate gradient method to efficiently solve large-scale linear equations to achieve better scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that the resulting network topologies outperform the benchmark topologies in terms of consensus speed, and reduce the training time required for decentralized learning tasks on real-world datasets to achieve the target test accuracy, exhibiting speedups of more than $1.11\\times$ and $1.21\\times$ for homogeneous and heterogeneous bandwidth settings, respectively.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07536v1\n    "}}

Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models.

Existing verification approaches are either restricted to small hardware gadgets, small programs on CPUs such as Sboxes, limited leakage models, or require hardware-specific prior knowledge. In this work, we present aLEAKator, an open-source framework for the automated formal verification of masked cryptographic accelerators and software running on CPUs from their HDL descriptions. Our method introduces mixed-domain simulation, enabling precise modeling and verification under various (including robust and relaxed) 1-probing leakage models, and supports variable signal granularity without being restricted to 1-bit wires. aLEAKator also supports verification in the presence of lookup tables, and does not require prior knowledge of the target CPU architecture. Our approach is validated against existing tools and real-world measurements while providing innovative results such as the verification of a full, first-order masked AES on various CPUs\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07520v1\n    "}}

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v2\n    "}}

This setup poses challenges in achieving consistent lattice distribution across the sphere for comparison with planar models. We employ Monte Carlo simulations, principal component analysis (PCA), graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to study spin configurations across a range of temperatures and to determine phase transition temperatures. The Fibonacci lattice, despite its uniformity, contains irregular sites that influence spin behavior. In the ferromagnetic case, sites with fewer neighbors exhibit a higher tendency for spin flips at low temperatures, though this effect weakens as temperature increases, leading to a higher phase transition temperature than in the planar Ising model. In the antiferromagnetic case, lattice irregularities induce geometric frustration, resulting in highly degenerate ground states and the phase transition temperature lower than the planar square lattice. Phase transition temperatures are derived through specific heat, magnetic susceptibility analysis and GCNs predictions, yielding $T_c$ values for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic scenarios. This work emphasizes the impact of the Fibonacci lattice's geometric properties-namely curvature and connectivity-on spin interactions in non-planar systems, with relevance to microgravity environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12007v3\n    "}}

Storing valuable trained ML models on user devices exposes them to potential extraction by adversaries. The current mainstream solution for on-device model protection is storing the weights and conducting inference within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, due to limited trusted memory that cannot accommodate the whole model, most existing approaches employ a partitioning strategy, dividing a model into multiple slices that are loaded into the TEE sequentially. This frequent interaction between untrusted and trusted worlds dramatically increases inference latency, sometimes by orders of magnitude. In this paper, we propose Amulet, a fast TEE-shielded on-device inference framework for ML model protection. Amulet incorporates a suite of obfuscation methods specifically designed for common neural network architectures. After obfuscation by the TEE, the entire transformed model can be securely stored in untrusted memory, allowing the inference process to execute directly in untrusted memory with GPU acceleration. For each inference request, only two rounds of minimal-overhead interaction between untrusted and trusted memory are required to process input samples and output results. We also provide theoretical proof from an information-theoretic perspective that the obfuscated model does not leak information about the original weights. We comprehensively evaluated Amulet using diverse model architectures ranging from ResNet-18 to GPT-2. Our approach incurs inference latency only 2.8-4.8x that of unprotected models with negligible accuracy loss, achieving an 8-9x speedup over baseline methods that execute inference entirely within TEEs, and performing approximately 2.2x faster than the state-of-the-art obfuscation-based method.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07495v1\n    "}}

Thus, a method to efficiently schedule a sequence of lattice-surgery operations is vital for high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computing. A possible strategy to improve the throughput of lattice-surgery operations is splitting a large instruction into several small instructions such as Bell state preparation and measurements and executing a part of them in advance. However, scheduling methods to fully utilize this idea have yet to be explored. In this paper, we propose a fast and high-performance scheduling algorithm for lattice-surgery instructions leveraging this strategy. We achieved this by converting the scheduling problem of lattice-surgery instructions to a graph problem of embedding 3D paths into a 3D lattice, which enables us to explore efficient scheduling by solving path search problems in the 3D lattice. Based on this reduction, we propose a method to solve the path-finding problems, look-ahead Dijkstra projection. We numerically show that this method reduced the execution time of benchmark programs generated from quantum phase estimation algorithms by 3.8 times compared with a naive method based on greedy algorithms. Our study establishes the relation between the lattice-surgery scheduling and graph search problems, which leads to further theoretical analysis on compiler optimization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15829v3\n    "}}

We present WaggleNet, a novel dual-scope monitoring system that simultaneously captures both internal hive conditions and external environmental parameters using a cost-effective LoRa-MQTT architecture. Our system deploys modular worker nodes ($\\sim$\\$15 each) equipped with temperature, humidity, light, and GPS sensors both inside and around beehives. A master node functions as a LoRa-MQTT gateway, forwarding data to a cloud server with a mobile application interface. Field experiments confirmed reliable operation with 100\\% packet delivery over 110 meters in line-of-sight conditions and 95 meters in obstructed environments, including successful deployment inside wooden hive structures. Our system demonstrated stable end-to-end latency under 5 seconds and continuous operation over a two-month period across diverse environmental conditions. By bridging the gap between internal and external monitoring, WaggleNet enables contextual anomaly detection and supports data-driven precision beekeeping in resource-constrained settings.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07408v1\n    "}}

While so-called non-Markovian dynamics is common in larger systems with interacting components, observations in fundamental physical systems have been confined to specifically engineered cases. Here, we report the experimental observation of non-Markovian dynamics in an elemental material, crystalline cobalt. By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07378v1\n    "}}

To understand the challenges software companies face in developing secure software, we conducted an interview study with 19 industry experts from 12 cross-industry companies. The results of our study show that the challenges are mainly due to high complexity, a lack of security awareness, and unsuitable processes, which are further exacerbated by an immediate lack of skilled personnel.

However, past research showed that they often lack legal expertise and struggle with privacy-compliant development. To shed light on how effective current information sources are in supporting them with privacy-sensitive implementation, we conducted a qualitative study with 30 developers. Participants were presented with a privacy-sensitive scenario and asked to identify privacy issues and suggest measures using their knowledge, online resources, and an AI assistant. We observed developers' decision-making in think-aloud sessions and discussed it in follow-up interviews. We found that participants struggled with all three sources: personal knowledge was insufficient, web content was often too complex, and while AI assistants provided clear and user-tailored responses, they lacked contextual relevance and failed to identify scenario-specific issues. Our study highlights major shortcomings in existing support for privacy-related development tasks. Based on our findings, we discuss the need for more accessible, understandable, and actionable privacy resources for developers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08059v2\n    "}}

In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfiltration attack based on image compression techniques.\n  This attack, termed Data Exfiltration by Compression, requires only access to a data lake and is based on lossless or lossy image compression methods. Unlike previous data exfiltration attacks, it is compatible with any image processing task and depends solely on an exported network model without requiring any additional information to be collected during the training process. We explore various scenarios, and techniques to limit the size of the exported model and conceal the compression codes within the network.\n  Using two public datasets of CT and MR images, we demonstrate that this attack can effectively steal medical images and reconstruct them outside the data lake with high fidelity, achieving an optimal balance between compression and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we investigate the impact of basic differential privacy measures, such as adding Gaussian noise to the model parameters, to prevent the Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack. We also show how the attacker can make their attack resilient to differential privacy at the expense of decreasing the number of stolen images. Lastly, we propose an alternative prevention strategy by fine-tuning the model to be exported.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21227v2\n    "}}

Compared to large language models (LLMs) processing 1D sequences, their memory consumption scales cubically, necessitating parallel serving across multiple GPUs. Traditional parallelism strategies partition the computational graph, requiring frequent high-dimensional activation transfers that create severe communication bottlenecks. To tackle this issue, we exploit the local spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the diffusion denoising process and propose Latent Parallelism (LP), the first parallelism strategy tailored for VDM serving. \\textcolor{black}{LP decomposes the global denoising problem into parallelizable sub-problems by dynamically rotating the partitioning dimensions (temporal, height, and width) within the compact latent space across diffusion timesteps, substantially reducing the communication overhead compared to prevailing parallelism strategies.} To ensure generation quality, we design a patch-aligned overlapping partition strategy that matches partition boundaries with visual patches and a position-aware latent reconstruction mechanism for smooth stitching. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that LP reduces communication overhead by up to 97\\% over baseline methods while maintaining comparable generation quality. As a non-intrusive plug-in paradigm, LP can be seamlessly integrated with existing parallelism strategies, enabling efficient and scalable video generation services.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07350v1\n    "}}

While recent efforts extensively explore advancing VLMs' reasoning power in these cases, deployment constraints are overlooked, leading to overwhelming system overhead in real-world deployments. To address that, we propose Venus, an on-device memory-and-retrieval system for efficient online video understanding. Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07344v1\n    "}}

In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged.\n  To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines.

Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing.\n  We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups.\n  Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency. Our findings explore the potential of the shared cache design to assist the development of future AI accelerator systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07312v1\n    "}}

Conventional labeling-based sorting methods, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting and magnetic-activated cell sorting, enable precise sorting when reliable markers are available. However, their applicability is limited in cells lacking defined markers or sensitive to labeling, as labeling can compromise cellular viability and function. We present a single-cell identification approach using quantum-enhanced NMR with diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers for label-free detection of intracellular proton ($^1$H) signals. Using this method, we distinguish two human tumor cell lines by their proton spin-lattice ($T_1$) relaxation times, which serve as a cell-intrinsic physicochemical signature. It lays the groundwork for label-free sorting applications in rare cell analysis, personalized medicine, and single-cell diagnostics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07307v1\n    "}}

Yet the susceptibility of modern smartphones to physical side-channel analysis (SCA) is underexplored, with recent work limited to pre-2019 hardware. Since then, smartphone system on chip (SoC) platforms have grown more complex, with heterogeneous processor clusters, sub 10 nm nodes, and frequencies over 2 GHz, potentially complicating SCA. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of electromagnetic (EM) SCA on a Raspberry Pi 4, featuring a Broadcom BCM2711 SoC and a Fairphone 4 featuring a Snapdragon 750G 5G SoC. Using new attack methodologies tailored to modern SoCs, we recover ECDSA secrets from OpenSSL by mounting the Nonce@Once attack of Alam et al. (Euro S&P 2021) and show that the libgcrypt countermeasure does not fully mitigate it. We present case studies illustrating how hardware and software stacks impact EM SCA feasibility. Motivated by use cases such as the EUDI wallet, we survey Android cryptographic implementations and define representative threat models to assess the attack. Our findings show weaknesses in ECDSA software implementations and underscore the need for independently certified secure elements (SEs) in all smartphones.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07292v1\n    "}}

By representing assets such as bonds, commodities, and real estate on blockchains, RWAs can enhance liquidity, broaden accessibility, and extend the scope of decentralized finance. Industry forecasts further suggest rapid growth of tokenized RWAs in the coming years, underscoring their potential role in the evolution of digital financial markets. However, when deployed across multiple blockchains, RWAs face challenges such as repeated authentication on different chains and inefficiency caused by multi-step settlement protocols. To address these issues, we present a cross-chain framework for RWAs that emphasizes identity management, authentication, and interaction. The framework integrates Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials with customized attributes to support decentralized identification, and incorporates an authentication protocol based on Simplified Payment Verification to avoid redundant verification across chains. Furthermore, we design a cross-chain channel that enables the settlement of RWAs without requiring channel closure, thereby improving operational efficiency. We implement the framework and evaluate it through simulations, which confirm its feasibility and demonstrate improvements in efficiency for RWAs in cross-chain settings.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12957v3\n    "}}

However, modern Industrial Internet of Things systems increasingly operate over distributed, resource-constrained edge-cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes a structured approach for decentralizing process mining by enabling event data to be mined directly within the IoT systems edge-cloud continuum. We introduce ContinuumConductor a layered decision framework that guides when to perform process mining tasks such as preprocessing, correlation, and discovery centrally or decentrally. Thus, enabling privacy, responsive and resource-efficient process mining. For each step in the process mining pipeline, we analyze the trade-offs of decentralization versus centralization across these layers and propose decision criteria. We demonstrate ContinuumConductor at a real-world use-case of process optimazition in inland ports.

Such privately adapted LLMs are regarded as either personal privacy assets or corporate intellectual property. Therefore, protecting model weights and maintaining strict confidentiality during deployment and distribution have become critically important. However, existing model formats and deployment frameworks provide little to no built-in support for confidentiality, access control, or secure integration with trusted hardware. Current methods for securing model deployment either rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques or tightly controlled private infrastructure. Although these approaches can be effective in specific scenarios, they are difficult and costly for widespread deployment.\n  In this paper, we introduce CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure for confidential LLM distribution. Built as an extension to the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors incorporates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control policies, while preserving critical features such as lazy loading and partial deserialization. It enables transparent decryption and automated key management, supporting flexible licensing and secure model execution with minimal overhead. We implement a proof-of-concept library, benchmark its performance across serialization and runtime scenarios, and validate its compatibility with existing inference frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. Our results highlight CryptoTensors as a light-weight, efficient, and developer-friendly solution for safeguarding LLM weights in real-world and widespread deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04580v2\n    "}}

However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07247v1\n    "}}

A common defence embeds invisible perturbations into images, but these are fragile and often destroyed by basic transformations such as compression or resizing. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 30 transformations across six categories and show that protection robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of training transformations, making the standard Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with uniform sampling fundamentally suboptimal. Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with 26% higher average robustness and up to 30% gains on challenging transformation categories.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07228v1\n    "}}

The key insight is a new observation of file redirection: for model training, when training data in one file is requested, the system has the flexibility to return the data of another file. Based on this property, Redox starts with a bold design principle that chunks of data files are always read from disk in batch, and once loaded, all files in the chunk will be consumed without being loaded again. We propose efficient local and distributed file read protocol based on this principle that both minimizes the wasted data read and enables opportunistic prefetch from remote node. Moreover, we analyze file redirection's impact on randomness, and show that it has little effects on training efficiency. Experimental results indicate that Redox significantly accelerates data fetching in training, achieving up to a 4.57x improvement in end-to-end training compared to PyTorch.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16280v2\n    "}}

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07220v1\n    "}}

Existing safety evaluation benchmarks and frameworks are often limited by an imbalanced integration of core components (attack, defense, and evaluation methods) and an isolation between flexible evaluation frameworks and standardized benchmarking capabilities. These limitations hinder reliable cross-study comparisons and create unnecessary overhead for comprehensive risk assessment. To address these gaps, we present TeleAI-Safety, a modular and reproducible framework coupled with a systematic benchmark for rigorous LLM safety evaluation. Our framework integrates a broad collection of 19 attack methods (including one self-developed method), 29 defense methods, and 19 evaluation methods (including one self-developed method). With a curated attack corpus of 342 samples spanning 12 distinct risk categories, the TeleAI-Safety benchmark conducts extensive evaluations across 14 target models. The results reveal systematic vulnerabilities and model-specific failure cases, highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and utility, and identifying potential defense patterns for future optimization. In practical scenarios, TeleAI-Safety can be flexibly adjusted with customized attack, defense, and evaluation combinations to meet specific demands. We release our complete code and evaluation results to facilitate reproducible research and establish unified safety baselines.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05485v2\n    "}}

Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification accuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain that surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07040v2\n    "}}

However, a critical vulnerability persists: user privacy during file retrieval remains largely unaddressed, risking the exposure of sensitive information. To overcome this, we introduce PIR-DSN, the first DSN protocol to integrate Private Information Retrieval (PIR) for both single and multi-server settings. Our key innovations include a novel secure mapping method that transforms sparse file identifiers into compact integer indexes, enabling both public verifiability of file operations and efficient private retrieval. Furthermore, PIR-DSN guarantees Byzantine-robust private retrieval through file replication across multiple miners. We implement and rigorously evaluate PIR-DSN against three prominent industrial DSN systems. Experimental results demonstrate that PIR-DSN achieves comparable overhead for file upload and deletion. While PIR inherently introduces an additional computational cost leading to higher retrieval latency, PIR-DSN maintains comparable throughput. These findings underscore PIR-DSN's practical viability for privacy-sensitive applications within DSN environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07189v1\n    "}}

Several solutions have already been proposed to prevent attacks, minimize damage, and divert hackers and intruders. Among these, the honeypot stands out as a highly effective tool; it is designed to mimic both a scanner and an attacker, diverting and misleading them within a simulated, production-level environment.

Despite these advances, their memory requirements are still excessively high, thereby hindering GNN training on large graphs using commodity workstations. In this paper, we propose SDT-GNN, a streaming-based distributed GNN training framework. Unlike the existing frameworks that load the entire graph in memory, it takes a stream of edges as input for graph partitioning to reduce the memory requirement for partitioning. It also enables distributed GNN training even when the aggregated memory size of GPUs is smaller than the size of the graph and feature data. Furthermore, to improve the quality of partitioning, we propose SPRING, a novel streaming partitioning algorithm for distributed GNN training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SDT-GNN on seven large public datasets. SDT-GNN has up to 95% less memory footprint than DistDGL and PyG without sacrificing the prediction accuracy. SPRING also outperforms state-of-the-art streaming partitioning algorithms significantly.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02300v2\n    "}}

We introduce MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a framework that measures how network structure shapes leakage. MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\\in\\{4,5,6\\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. These results provide the first systematic mapping from architectural choices to measurable privacy risk, yielding actionable guidance: prefer sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, limit node degree and network radius, avoid shortcuts bypassing hubs, and implement topology-aware access controls.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04668v2\n    "}}

However, the traditional centralized learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30 datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming its superior efficiency and scalability.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18657v3\n    "}}

However, spin qubit devices face a key architectural bottleneck: the large physical footprint of readout components relative to qubits prevents a dense layout where all qubits can be measured simultaneously, complicating the implementation of quantum error correction. This challenge is offset by the platform's unique rapid shuttling capability, which can be used to transport qubits to distant readout ports. In this work, we explore the design constraints and capabilities of spin qubits in silicon and propose the SNAQ (Shuttling-capable Narrow Array of spin Qubits) surface code architecture, which relaxes the 1:1 readout-to-qubit assumption by leveraging spin shuttling to time-multiplex ancilla qubit initialization and readout. Our analysis shows that, given sufficiently high (experimentally demonstrated) qubit coherence times, SNAQ delivers an orders-of-magnitude reduction in chip area per logical qubit. Additionally, by using a denser grid of physical qubits, SNAQ enables fast transversal logic for short-distance logical operations, achieving 4.0-22.3x improvement in local logical clock speed while still supporting global operations via lattice surgery. This translates to a 57-60% reduction in spacetime cost of 15-to-1 magic state distillation, a key fault-tolerant subroutine. Our work pinpoints critical hardware metrics and provides a compelling path toward high-performance fault-tolerant computation on near-term-manufacturable spin qubit arrays.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07131v1\n    "}}

It examines traffic payloads by searching for regular expressions (regex) with the Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) model. However, as the network bandwidth and ruleset size are increasing rapidly, the conventional DFA model has emerged as a significant performance bottleneck of DPI. Leveraging the Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) instruction to perform state transitions can substantially boost the efficiency of the DFA model. In this paper, we propose Hyperflex, a novel SIMD-based DFA model designed for high-performance regex matching. Hyperflex incorporates a region detection algorithm to identify regions suitable for acceleration by SIMD instructions across the whole DFA graph. Also, we design a hybrid state transition algorithm that enables state transition in both SIMD-accelerated and normal regions, and ensures seamless state transition across the two types of regions. We have implemented Hyperflex on the commodity CPU and evaluated it with real network traffic and DPI regexes.

Although differential privacy (DP) with private voting is a pragmatic mitigation, DP-ICL implementations are error-prone, and worst-case DP bounds may substantially overestimate actual leakage, calling for practical auditing tools. We present a tight and efficient privacy auditing framework for DP-ICL systems that runs membership inference attacks and translates their success rates into empirical privacy guarantees using Gaussian DP. Our analysis of the private voting mechanism identifies vote configurations that maximize the auditing signal, guiding the design of audit queries that reliably reveal whether a canary demonstration is present in the context. The framework supports both black-box (API-only) and white-box (internal vote) threat models, and unifies auditing for classification and generation by reducing both to a binary decision problem. Experiments on standard text classification and generation benchmarks show that our empirical leakage estimates closely match theoretical DP budgets on classification tasks and are consistently lower on generation tasks due to conservative embedding-sensitivity bounds, making our framework a practical privacy auditor and verifier for real-world DP-ICL deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13502v2\n    "}}

However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09442v3\n    "}}

These challenges underscore the need for a novel modeling and simulation paradigm tailored to the unique characteristics of MM sessions, along with specialized service provisioning strategies capable of capturing their interactive, heterogeneous, and multicast-oriented nature. To this end, we make a first attempt to formally model and analyze the problem of service provisioning for MM sessions in 5G/6G networks. We first formalize service and network graph models for the MM, using \"live audience interaction in a virtual concert\" as a reference scenario. We then present MuMeNet, a novel discrete-event network simulator specifically tailored to the requirements and the traffic dynamics of the MM. We showcase the effectiveness of MuMeNet by running a linear programming based orchestration policy on the reference scenario and providing performance analysis under realistic MM workloads.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05201v2\n    "}}

Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models.

As their computational requirements continue to grow, these models are increasingly deployed as cloud-based services, allowing users to access powerful LLMs via the Internet. However, this deployment model introduces a new class of threat: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unbounded reasoning, where adversaries craft specially designed inputs that cause the model to enter excessively long or infinite generation loops. These attacks can exhaust backend compute resources, degrading or denying service to legitimate users. To mitigate such risks, many LLM providers adopt a closed-source, black-box setting to obscure model internals. In this paper, we propose ThinkTrap, a novel input-space optimization framework for DoS attacks against LLM services even in black-box environments. The core idea of ThinkTrap is to first map discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, then undertake efficient black-box optimization in a low-dimensional subspace exploiting input sparsity. The goal of this optimization is to identify adversarial prompts that induce extended or non-terminating generation across several state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving DoS with minimal token overhead. We evaluate the proposed attack across multiple commercial, closed-source LLM services. Our results demonstrate that, even far under the restrictive request frequency limits commonly enforced by these platforms, typically capped at ten requests per minute (10 RPM), the attack can degrade service throughput to as low as 1% of its original capacity, and in some cases, induce complete service failure.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07086v1\n    "}}

At the core of this abstraction lies the ledger, an append-only log of the prompt-response interaction history between a model and its user. Each mechanism produces deterministic decisions based on the ledger and an explicit selection criterion, making it well-suited to serve as a ground truth for attribution. We frame the design goal of watermarking schemes as faithful representation of ideal attribution mechanisms. This novel perspective brings conceptual clarity, replacing piecemeal probabilistic statements with a unified language for stating the guarantees of each scheme. It also enables precise reasoning about desiderata for future watermarking schemes, even when no current construction achieves them, since the ideal functionalities are specified first. In this way, the framework provides a roadmap that clarifies which guarantees are attainable in an idealized setting and worth pursuing in practice.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07038v1\n    "}}

This model simplifies operational management but shifts control of authentication material from the domain owner to the platform. The implications of this shift during provider transitions remain insufficiently examined. This study investigates how managed TLS platforms behave when a domain is moved away from the platform that originally issued and stored its certificate. A controlled measurement environment was used to monitor multiple platforms after migration. Each platform was observed for the full remaining lifetime of the certificate that had been active during delegation. The measurements show that platforms continue to serve the same certificate until it expires, even after DNS resolvers direct traffic toward new infrastructure. No platform revoked, replaced, or retired the certificate, and no new certificate was issued after delegation ended. Direct connections to the previous platform continued to complete TLS handshakes with the stale certificate, which confirms that authentication capability persisted independently of DNS state. These findings indicate that authentication authority remains with the previous platform for the entire lifetime of certificates issued during the delegation period. The gap between DNS control and control of authentication material introduces a window in which multiple environments can authenticate the same domain. As managed TLS adoption grows, clearer mechanisms for key retirement and certificate invalidation are needed to ensure that the authentication authority follows operational authority during transitions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07033v1\n    "}}

There are many Machine Learning (ML) models designed to analyze and detect network attacks, especially using supervised models. However, these models are designed to classify samples (normal and attacks) based on the patterns they learn during the training phase, so they perform inefficiently on unseen attacks. This research addresses this issue by evaluating five different supervised models to assess their performance and execution time in predicting zero-day attacks and find out which model performs accurately and quickly. The goal is to improve the performance of these supervised models by not only proposing a framework that applies grid search, dimensionality reduction and oversampling methods to overcome the imbalance problem, but also comparing the effectiveness of oversampling on ml model metrics, in particular the accuracy. To emulate attack detection in real life, this research applies a highly imbalanced data set and only exposes the classifiers to zero-day attacks during the testing phase, so the models are not trained to flag the zero-day attacks. Our results show that Random Forest (RF) performs best under both oversampling and non-oversampling conditions, this increased effectiveness comes at the cost of longer processing times. Therefore, we selected XG Boost (XGB) as the top model due to its fast and highly accurate performance in detecting zero-day attacks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07030v1\n    "}}

We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719v5\n    "}}

In this context, we first show that a classical algorithm naturally satisfies LDP and then design two new algorithms that improve it: RW-AdaBatch and RW-Meta. For RW-AdaBatch, we exploit the limited-switching behavior induced by LDP to provide a novel form of privacy amplification that grows stronger on easier data, analogous to the shuffle model in offline learning. Drawing on the theory of random walks, we prove that this improvement carries essentially no utility cost. For RW-Meta, we develop a general method for privately selecting between experts that are themselves non-trivial learning algorithms, and we show that in the context of LDP this carries no extra privacy cost. In contrast, prior work has only considered data-independent experts. We also derive formal regret bounds that scale inversely with the degree of independence between experts. Our analysis is supplemented by evaluation on real-world data reported by hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic; RW-Meta outperforms both the classical baseline and a state-of-the-art \\textit{central} DP algorithm by 1.5-3$\\times$ on the task of predicting which hospital will report the highest density of COVID patients each week.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06971v1\n    "}}

The channel model is characterized by correlations among the parties, with the parties assumed to be either honest-but-curious or, in the receiver's case, potentially malicious. At first, we study the information-theoretical limits of oblivious transfer between two parties and extend it to the multiple access channel model. We propose a multiparty protocol for honest-but-curious parties where the general multiple access channel is reduced to a certain correlation. In scenarios where the receiver is malicious, the protocol achieves an achievable rate region.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17021v3\n    "}}

For solid-state platforms, spin decoherence is dominated by the magneto-active environment in the lattice, limiting their applicability. While standard dynamical decoupling techniques, such as the Hahn echo, extend central spin coherence, they fail to suppress the fast noise arising from strong dipolar interactions within the bath. Here, we present a decoupling mechanism, Hybrid-LG, that suppresses intra-bath dipolar interactions -- thus, fast noise acting on spin qubits- and demonstrate its effectiveness in extending spin coherence through efficient in-house CCE simulations. Specifically, we investigate one of the most widely exploited solid-state quantum platforms: an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond coupled to a large and dense bath of substitutional nitrogen paramagnetic impurities (P1 centers). Our results reveal at least a twofold enhancement in NV coherence time relative to standard techniques including P1 center driving, without requiring additional control power.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06948v1\n    "}}

These attacks commonly occur through fraudulent messages, misleading advertisements, and compromised legitimate websites. This study proposes a Quantile Regression Deep Q-Network (QR-DQN) approach that integrates RoBERTa semantic embeddings with handcrafted lexical features to enhance phishing detection while accounting for uncertainties. Unlike traditional DQN methods that estimate single scalar Q-values, QR-DQN leverages quantile regression to model the distribution of returns, improving stability and generalization on unseen phishing data. A diverse dataset of 105,000 URLs was curated from PhishTank, OpenPhish, Cloudflare, and other sources, and the model was evaluated using an 80/20 train-test split. The QR-DQN framework achieved a test accuracy of 99.86%, precision of 99.75%, recall of 99.96%, and F1-score of 99.85%, demonstrating high effectiveness. Compared to standard DQN with lexical features, the hybrid QR-DQN with lexical and semantic features reduced the generalization gap from 1.66% to 0.04%, indicating significant improvement in robustness. Five-fold cross-validation confirmed model reliability, yielding a mean accuracy of 99.90% with a standard deviation of 0.04%. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid approach effectively identifies phishing threats, adapts to evolving attack strategies, and generalizes well to unseen data.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06925v1\n    "}}

However, this paradigm revives the classic cybersecurity challenges of agency and authorization in a novel and volatile context. As decision-making shifts from deterministic code logic to probabilistic inference driven by natural language, traditional security mechanisms designed for deterministic behavior fail. It is fundamentally challenging to establish trust for unpredictable AI agents and to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) when instructions are ambiguous. Despite the escalating threat landscape, the academic community's understanding of this emerging domain remains fragmented, lacking a systematic framework to analyze its root causes. This paper provides a unifying formal lens for agent-interaction security.\n  We observed that most security threats in this domain stem from a fundamental mismatch between trust evaluation and authorization policies. We introduce a novel risk analysis model centered on this trust-authorization gap. Using this model as a unifying lens, we survey and classify the implementation paths of existing, often seemingly isolated, attacks and defenses. This new framework not only unifies the field but also allows us to identify critical research gaps. Finally, we leverage our analysis to suggest a systematic research direction toward building robust, trusted agents and dynamic authorization mechanisms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06914v1\n    "}}

This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for tamper-proof data and transaction management.

The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing within 2\\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable of handling variability in solar and wind generation.

Many modern web applications operate on web APIs (e.g., RESTful, SOAP, and WebSockets), their exposure invites intended attacks or unintended illegal visits, causing abnormal system behaviors. However, such anomalies can share very similar logs with normal logs, missing crucial information (which could be in database) for log discrimination. Further, log instances can be also noisy, which can further mislead the state-of-the-art log learning solutions to learn spurious correlation, resulting superficial models and rules for anomaly detection. In this work, we propose MINES which infers explainable API invariants for anomaly detection from the schema level instead of detailed raw log instances, which can (1) significantly discriminate noise in logs to identify precise normalities and (2) detect abnormal behaviors beyond the instrumented logs. Technically, MINES (1) converts API signatures into table schema to enhance the original database shema; and (2) infers the potential database constraints on the enhanced database schema to capture the potential relationships between APIs and database tables. MINES uses LLM for extracting potential relationship based on two given table structures; and use normal log instances to reject and accept LLM-generated invariants. Finally, MINES translates the inferred constraints into invariants to generate Python code for verifying the runtime logs. We extensively evaluate MINES on web-tamper attacks on the benchmarks of TrainTicket, NiceFish, Gitea, Mastodon, and NextCloud against baselines such as LogRobust, LogFormer, and WebNorm. The results show that MINES achieves high recall for the anomalies while introducing almost zero false positives, indicating a new state-of-the-art.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06906v1\n    "}}

We identify a critical flaw that fine-tuning on downstream tasks inevitably modifies model parameters, shifting the output distribution and rendering pre-computed defense ineffective. To address this, we propose Patronus, a novel framework that use input-side invariance of triggers against parameter shifts. To overcome the convergence challenges of discrete text optimization, Patronus introduces a multi-trigger contrastive search algorithm that effectively bridges gradient-based optimization with contrastive learning objectives. Furthermore, we employ a dual-stage mitigation strategy combining real-time input monitoring with model purification via adversarial training. Extensive experiments across 15 PLMs and 10 tasks demonstrate that Patronus achieves $\\geq98.7\\%$ backdoor detection recall and reduce attack success rates to clean settings, significantly outperforming all state-of-the-art baselines in all settings.

Existing solutions face critical limitations: TCP's head-of-line blocking stalls time-sensitive data, UDP lacks reliability and congestion control, and cellular networks designed for terrestrial users degrade severely for aerial platforms. This paper introduces AQUILA, a cross-layer communication architecture built on QUIC to address these challenges. AQUILA contributes three key innovations: (1) a unified transport layer using QUIC's reliable streams for MAVLink Command and Control (C2) and unreliable datagrams for video, eliminating head-of-line blocking under unified congestion control; (2) a priority scheduling mechanism that structurally ensures C2 latency remains bounded and independent of video traffic intensity; (3) a UAV-adapted congestion control algorithm extending SCReAM with altitude-adaptive delay targeting and telemetry headroom reservation. AQUILA further implements 0-RTT connection resumption to minimize handover blackouts with application-layer replay protection, deployed over an IP-native architecture enabling global operation. Experimental validation demonstrates that AQUILA significantly outperforms TCP- and UDP-based approaches in C2 latency, video quality, and link resilience under realistic conditions, providing a robust foundation for autonomous BVLOS missions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06889v1\n    "}}

However, due to the resource-intensive nature of training LLMs from scratch, it is urgent and crucial to protect the intellectual property of LLMs against infringement. This has motivated the authors in this paper to propose a novel black-box fingerprinting technique for LLMs. We firstly demonstrate that the outputs of LLMs span a unique vector space associated with each model. We model the problem of fingerprint authentication as the task of evaluating the similarity between the space of the victim model and the space of the suspect model. To tackle with this problem, we introduce two solutions: the first determines whether suspect outputs lie within the victim's subspace, enabling fast infringement detection; the second reconstructs a joint subspace to detect models modified via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Experiments indicate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in fingerprint verification and robustness against the PEFT attacks. This work reveals inherent characteristics of LLMs and provides a promising solution for protecting LLMs, ensuring efficiency, generality and practicality.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01235v2\n    "}}

This constraint imposes significant architectural challenges for applications requiring low-latency, multi-region access to objects that exceed these limits. The standard industry recommendation is to offload payloads to object storage (e.g., Amazon S3) while retaining a pointer in the database. While cost-efficient, this \"pointer pattern\" introduces network overhead and exposes applications to non-deterministic replication lag between the database and the object store, creating race conditions in active-active architectures.\n  This paper presents a \"chunked-object\" pattern that persists large logical entities as sets of ordered chunks within the database itself. We precisely define the pattern and provide a reference implementation using Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables. The design generalizes to any key-value store with per-item size limits and multi-region replication. We evaluate the approach using telemetry from a production system processing over 200,000 transactions per hour. Results demonstrate that the chunked-object pattern eliminates cross-system replication lag hazards and reduces p99 cross-region time-to-consistency for 1 MB payloads by keeping data and metadata within a single consistency domain.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06852v1\n    "}}

By systematically varying the disorder configuration -- including the values and probabilities of the multivariate distribution -- we demonstrate that both the number and width of TAI phases can be precisely engineered. Analytical determination of topological phase boundaries via the inverse localization length shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our results reveal a rich landscape of disorder-induced topological phase transitions, including multiple reentrant TAI phases that arise as the disorder amplitude increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean chiral displacement serves as a sensitive probe for detecting these topological transitions, providing a practical route for experimental realization in photonic waveguide lattices. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing quantum and photonic materials with customizable topological properties driven by tailored disorder.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06851v1\n    "}}

However, these methods face limitations in capturing both semantic structures and control logic. Knowledge graphs, by contrast, offer a structured representation of entities and relations, enabling richer intermediate abstractions of contract code and supporting the use of graph query languages to identify rule-violating elements. This paper presents CKG-LLM, a framework for detecting access-control vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Leveraging the reasoning and code generation capabilities of large language models, CKG-LLM translates natural-language vulnerability patterns into executable queries over contract knowledge graphs to automatically locate vulnerable code elements. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that CKG-LLM achieves superior performance in detecting access-control vulnerabilities compared to existing tools. Finally, we discuss potential extensions of CKG-LLM as part of future research directions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06846v1\n    "}}

The proposed PUF generates device-specific responses by measuring the pull-up and pull-down resistor values on the I/O pins of the ICs, which naturally vary across chips due to manufacturing-induced process variations. Since these resistors are already integrated into the I/O structures of most ICs, ioPUF+ requires no custom circuitry, and no new IC fabrication. This makes ioPUF+ suitable for cost-sensitive embedded systems built from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Beyond introducing a new PUF, ioPUF+ includes a complete datapath for converting raw PUF responses into cryptographically usable secret keys using BCH error correction and SHA-256 hashing. Further ioPUF+ also demonstrate a practical use case of PUF derive secret keys in securing device-to-device communication using AES-encryption. We implemented ioPUF+ on the Infineon PSoC-5 microcontroller and evaluated its performance across 30 devices using standard PUF metrics. The results show excellent reliability (intra-device Hamming distance of 100.00%), strong uniqueness (inter-device Hamming distance of 50.33%), near-ideal uniformity (50.54%), and negligible bit aliasing. Stability tests under temperature and supply-voltage variations show worst-case bit-error rates of only 2.63% and 2.10%, respectively. We also profiled the resource and energy usage of the complete ioPUF+ system, including the PUF primitive, BCH decoding, SHA-256 hashing, and AES encryption. The full implementation requires only 19.8 KB of Flash, exhibits a latency of 600 ms, and consumes 79 mW of power, demonstrating the suitabilitiy of ioPUF+ for resource-constrained IoT nodes.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18412v2\n    "}}

On Ethernet these guarantees are delivered by the set of tools within IEEE 802.1 time sensitive networking~(TSN) standards. Credit-based shaper (CBS) is one such tool which enforces bounded latency. Directly porting CBS to 5G/6G New Radio (NR) is non-trivial because NR schedules traffic in discrete-time, modulation-dependent resource allocation, whereas CBS assumes a continuous, fixed-rate link. Existing TSN-over-5G translators map Ethernet priorities to 5G quality of service (QoS) identifiers but leave the radio scheduler unchanged, so deterministic delay is lost within the radio access network (RAN). To address this challenge, we propose a novel slot-native approach that adapts CBS to operate natively in discrete NR slots. We first propose a per-slot credit formulation for each user-equipment ({UE}) queue that debits credit by the granted transport block size~(TBS); we call this discrete-time CBS (CBS-DT). Recognizing that debiting the full {TBS} can unduly penalize transmissions that actually use only part of their grant, we then introduce and analyze {CBS} with Partial Usage ({CBS-PU}). {CBS-PU} scales the credit debit in proportion to the actual bytes dequeued from the downlink queue. The resulting CBS-PU algorithm is shown to maintain bounded credit, preserve long-term rate reservations, and guarantees worst-case delay performance no worse than {CBS-DT}. Simulation results show that slot-level credit gating--particularly CBS-PU--enables NR to export TSN class QoS while maximizing resource utilization.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12091v2\n    "}}

Edge solutions facilitate real-time machine learning inference, but also require continuous adaptation to concept drifts. While extensions of the Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) remain state-of-the-art for tabular stream mining, their unregulated growth limits efficiency, particularly in ensemble settings where post-pruning at the individual tree level is seldom applied. This paper presents DFDT, a novel memory-constrained algorithm for online learning. DFDT employs activity-aware pre-pruning, dynamically adjusting splitting criteria based on leaf node activity: low-activity nodes are deactivated to conserve resources, moderately active nodes split under stricter conditions, and highly active nodes leverage a skipping mechanism for accelerated growth. Additionally, adaptive grace periods and tie thresholds allow DFDT to modulate splitting decisions based on observed data variability, enhancing the accuracy-memory-runtime trade-off while minimizing the need for hyperparameter tuning. An ablation study reveals three DFDT variants suited to different resource profiles. Fully compatible with existing ensemble frameworks, DFDT provides a drop-in alternative to standard VFDT-based learners.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14011v2\n    "}}

This paper reexamines the historical evolution of the field, including the initial ideas of resource sharing and utility-based computing approaches and the development of hyperscale data centers and modern globally federated cloud ecosystems. We also analyze the technological and economic forces and point to the way cloud platforms altered the organizational computing habits, decreasing the entrance-level to the data-intensive and computation-heavy apps. The study also takes into account the ongoing limitations which have come with the large-scale adoption of clouds which include exposure to security due to the weaknesses in configuration, particular establishment regulations, and structural reliance on the single vendors. Lastly, we address some of the new trends that are transforming the cloud environment, including the convergence of edge and cloud infrastructure, the increased prominence of AI-optimised architectures and the initial adoption of quantum computing services.

However, traditional token routing in distributed MoE training faces significant challenges in resource-constrained edge networks characterized by heterogeneous computing capabilities and stochastic token arrivals, which inevitably suffer from workload backlog, resource inefficiency, and performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Lyapunov-based token routing framework for distributed MoE training over resource-heterogeneous edge networks, termed Stable-MoE. Specifically, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem to maximize both system throughput and gating consistency via optimizing the token routing strategy and computational resource allocation, while ensuring long-term stability of both token and energy queues at the edge devices. Using the Lyapunov optimization, we transform the intractable long-term optimization problem into tractable per-slot subproblems by enabling online decision-making of token routing and computation frequency utilization without the knowledge of future system states. Experimental results on the SVHN and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that Stable-MoE outperforms the baselines with at least 40% and 5% gains in system throughput and test accuracy, respectively.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06784v1\n    "}}

This study investigates the potential of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), namely ChatGPT, Llama, Grok, DeepSeek, and Gemini, to automate this process by analyzing over 31{,}000 recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries. The results show that LLMs substantially outperform the baseline on certain metrics (e.g., \\textit{Availability Impact}), while offering more modest gains on others (e.g., \\textit{Attack Complexity}). Moreover, model performance varies across both LLM families and individual CVSS metrics, with ChatGPT-5 attaining the highest precision. Our analysis reveals that LLMs tend to misclassify many of the same CVEs, and ensemble-based meta-classifiers only marginally improve performance. Further examination shows that CVE descriptions often lack critical context or contain ambiguous phrasing, which contributes to systematic misclassifications. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing vulnerability descriptions and incorporating richer contextual details to support more reliable automated reasoning and alleviate the growing backlog of CVEs awaiting triage.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06781v1\n    "}}

However, the fate of the quantum Mpemba effect in systems with long-range interactions remains an open question. Here, we study the quantum Mpemba effect in long-ranged, U(1)-symmetric random unitary circuits. Using annealed R\u00e9nyi-2 entanglement asymmetry computed via replica tensor networks and exact diagonalization, we track the symmetry restoration from three types of tilted product states: ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferromagnetic with a central domain wall. The quantum Mpemba effect is present for tilted ferromagnetic states at all interaction ranges, but absent for tilted antiferromagnetic states, and occurs for the domain-wall state only in effectively short-ranged circuits, where the Mpemba time $t_{\\rm M}$ is found to scale with the subsystem size $N_A$ as $t_{\\rm M}\\!\\sim\\!N_{A}^{\\,z}$, with the dynamical exponent $z=\\min(\u03b1-1,2)$. These results reveal how the quantum Mpemba effect is governed by the interplay between interaction range and initial-state charge bias in long-ranged chaotic systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06775v1\n    "}}

In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06768v1\n    "}}

We mathematically verify that the lifted circuit reproduces the correct measurement statistics, analyze the depth overhead tradeoffs as a function of d, and provide numerical simulations in QuTiP for example values. Our approach demonstrates how higher-dimensional structures can be embedded into qubit devices and provides a general method for extending qudit algorithms to current hardware.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06756v1\n    "}}

We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings (3 datasets $\\times$ 2 retrievers $\\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points, 2.6$\\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00586v2\n    "}}

Existing approaches, such as backdoor watermarking, rely on inducing a detectable behavior into the trained model on a part of the data distribution. However, these approaches have limitations, as they can be harmful to the model's performances or require unpractical access to the model's internals. Most importantly, previous approaches lack guarantee against false positives. This paper introduces data taggants, a novel non-backdoor dataset ownership verification technique. Our method uses pairs of out-of-distribution samples and random labels as secret keys, and leverages clean-label targeted data poisoning to subtly alter a dataset, so that models trained on it respond to the key samples with the corresponding key labels. The keys are built as to allow for statistical certificates with black-box access only to the model. We validate our approach through comprehensive and realistic experiments on ImageNet1k using ViT and ResNet models with state-of-the-art training recipes. Our findings demonstrate that data taggants can reliably detect models trained on the protected dataset with high confidence, without compromising validation accuracy, and show their superiority over backdoor watermarking. We demonstrate the stealthiness and robustness of our method against various defense mechanisms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09101v2\n    "}}

However, existing LLM-driven UAV systems process sensitive operational data in plaintext, exposing them to privacy and security risks. This work introduces PrivLLMSwarm, a privacy-preserving framework that performs secure LLM inference for UAV swarm coordination through Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). The framework incorporates MPC-optimized transformer components with efficient approximations of nonlinear activations, enabling practical encrypted inference on resource-constrained aerial platforms. A fine-tuned GPT-based command generator, enhanced through reinforcement learning in simulation, provides reliable instructions while maintaining confidentiality. Experimental evaluation in urban-scale simulations demonstrates that PrivLLMSwarm achieves high semantic accuracy, low encrypted inference latency, and robust formation control under privacy constraints. Comparative analysis shows PrivLLMSwarm offers a superior privacy-utility balance compared to differential privacy, federated learning, and plaintext baselines. To support reproducibility, the full implementation including source code, MPC components, and a synthetic dataset is publicly available. PrivLLMSwarm establishes a practical foundation for secure, LLM-enabled UAV swarms in privacy-sensitive IoT applications including smart-city monitoring and emergency response.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06747v1\n    "}}

However, they often cause subtle yet looking-innocent deviations between normal and stego texts, posing potential security risks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a content-preserving linguistic steganography paradigm for perfectly secure covert communication without modifying the cover text. Based on this paradigm, we introduce CLstega (\\textit{C}ontent-preserving \\textit{L}inguistic \\textit{stega}nography), a novel method that embeds secret messages through controllable distribution transformation. CLstega first applies an augmented masking strategy to locate and mask embedding positions, where MLM(masked language model)-predicted probability distributions are easily adjustable for transformation. Subsequently, a dynamic distribution steganographic coding strategy is designed to encode secret messages by deriving target distributions from the original probability distributions. To achieve this transformation, CLstega elaborately selects target words for embedding positions as labels to construct a masked sentence dataset, which is used to fine-tune the original MLM, producing a target MLM capable of directly extracting secret messages from the cover text. This approach ensures perfect security of secret messages while fully preserving the integrity of the original cover text. Experimental results show that CLstega can achieve a 100\\% extraction success rate, and outperforms existing methods in security, effectively balancing embedding capacity and security.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12565v2\n    "}}

Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the homogeneous broadening is governed by the intra-chain dipolar field, and we establish design principles for optimizing coherence in future materials.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06722v1\n    "}}

These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated \"Intent Graph\"; and (ii) an innovative \"Tiered Adjudicator\" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06716v1\n    "}}

Moreover, directly migrating these frameworks to local small-scale models (LSMs) offers a suboptimal solution with catastrophic collapse in utility based on our core findings. Our work argues that this failure stems not merely from the capability deficits of LSMs, but from the inherent irrationality of the greedy adversarial strategies employed by current state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. We model the anonymization process as a trade-off between Marginal Privacy Gain (MPG) and Marginal Utility Cost (MUC), and demonstrate that greedy strategies inevitably drift into an irrational state. To address this, we propose Rational Localized Adversarial Anonymization (RLAA), a fully localized and training-free framework featuring an Attacker-Arbitrator-Anonymizer (A-A-A) architecture. RLAA introduces an arbitrator that acts as a rationality gatekeeper, validating the attacker's inference to filter out feedback providing negligible benefits on privacy preservation. This mechanism enforces a rational early-stopping criterion, and systematically prevents utility collapse. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that RLAA achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, and in some cases even outperforms SoTA on the Pareto principle. Our code and datasets will be released upon acceptance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06713v1\n    "}}

Quantum cryptographic conferencing serves as an essential solution to establish secure keys to realize secure multi-user communications. However, existing QCC implementations have been fundamentally limited by the low probability of multi-user coincidence detection to measure or construct the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state. In this work, we report the experimental realization of QCC eliminating the need for coincidence detection, where the GHZ state is constructed by correlating detection events occurring within the coherence time, thereby greatly enhancing the success probability of GHZ-state measurement. Meanwhile, to establish and maintain high-visibility GHZ measurement among three independent users, we developed a three-party phase compensation scheme combined with precise temporal and polarization alignment within a time-bin-phase encoding framework. Furthermore, we designed an efficient pairing strategy to simplify subsequent data processing and enhance processing efficiency. Based on these techniques, we successfully performed QCC experiments over total channel losses of 66.3 dB, corresponding to 331.5 km of commercial fiber (0.2 dB/km), achieving secure key rates of 5.4 bit/s, whereas previous QCC experiments have been limited to 100 km. The results surpass the multi-user repeaterless bound in quantum networks, establishing a new regime of scalable, multi-user quantum communication and paving the way for metropolitan quantum networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06661v1\n    "}}

Writing correct KQL requires specialized expertise, and this dependency creates a bottleneck as security teams scale. This paper investigates whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can enable accurate, cost-effective natural-language-to-KQL translation for enterprise security. We propose a three-knob framework targeting prompting, fine-tuning, and architecture design. First, we adapt existing NL2KQL framework for SLMs with lightweight retrieval and introduce error-aware prompting that addresses common parser failures without increasing token count. Second, we apply LoRA fine-tuning with rationale distillation, augmenting each NLQ-KQL pair with a brief chain-of-thought explanation to transfer reasoning from a teacher model while keeping the SLM compact. Third, we propose a two-stage architecture that uses an SLM for candidate generation and a low-cost LLM judge for schema-aware refinement and selection. We evaluate nine models (five SLMs and four LLMs) across syntax correctness, semantic accuracy, table selection, and filter precision, alongside latency and token cost. On Microsoft's NL2KQL Defender Evaluation dataset, our two-stage approach achieves 0.987 syntax and 0.906 semantic accuracy. We further demonstrate generalizability on Microsoft Sentinel data, reaching 0.964 syntax and 0.831 semantic accuracy. These results come at up to 10x lower token cost than GPT-5, establishing SLMs as a practical, scalable foundation for natural-language querying in security operations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06660v1\n    "}}

While individual large language models can summarize alerts or interpret unstructured reports, they fall short in real SOC environments that require grounded data access, reproducibility, and accountable workflows. In response, the field has seen a rapid architectural evolution from single-model helpers toward tool-augmented agents, distributed multi-agent systems, schema-bound tool ecosystems, and early explorations of semi-autonomous investigative pipelines. This survey presents a five-generation taxonomy of agentic AI in cybersecurity. It traces how capabilities and risks change as systems advance from text-only LLM reasoners to multi-agent collaboration frameworks and constrained-autonomy pipelines. We compare these generations across core dimensions - reasoning depth, tool use, memory, reproducibility, and safety. In addition, we also synthesize emerging benchmarks used to evaluate cyber-oriented agents. Finally, we outline the unresolved challenges that accompany this evolution, such as response validation, tool-use correctness, multi-agent coordination, long-horizon reasoning, and safeguards for high-impact actions. Collectively, this work provides a structured perspective on how agentic AI is taking shape within cybersecurity and what is required to ensure its safe and reliable deployment.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06659v1\n    "}}

Anonymous authentication plays an important role in privacy-preserving systems. A $k$-times anonymous authentication ($k$-TAA) scheme allows a group member to anonymously authenticate to the application provider up to $k$ times. Considering quantum computing attacks, lattice-based $k$-TAA was introduced. However, existing schemes neither support the dynamic granting and revocation of users nor enable users to control the release of their attributes. In this paper, we construct the first lattice-based dynamic $k$-TAA, which offers limited times anonymous authentication, dynamic member management, attribute-based authentication, and post-quantum security. We present a concrete construction, and reduce its security to standard complexity assumptions. Notably, compared with existing lattice-based $k$-TAA, our scheme is efficient in terms of communication cost.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21786v3\n    "}}

This vulnerability stems from an inherent trade-off governed by watermark window size: smaller windows resist scrubbing better but are easier to reverse-engineer, enabling low-cost statistics-based spoofing attacks. This work breaks this trade-off by introducing a novel mechanism, equivalent texture keys, where multiple tokens within a watermark window can independently support the detection. Based on the redundancy, we propose a novel watermark scheme with Sub-vocabulary decomposed Equivalent tExture Key (SEEK). It achieves a Pareto improvement, increasing the resilience against scrubbing attacks without compromising robustness to spoofing. Experiments demonstrate SEEK's superiority over prior method, yielding spoofing robustness gains of +88.2%/+92.3%/+82.0% and scrubbing robustness gains of +10.2%/+6.4%/+24.6% across diverse dataset settings.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06274v2\n    "}}

This raises serious concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs from the T2I system, is increasingly recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before real-world deployment. However, existing automated red teaming approaches often treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system. Unlike prior work that optimizes prompts individually, DREAM directly models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into a simple and tractable form. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient optimization algorithm that provides stable gradient estimates through the long and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. During inference, we also propose a diversity-aware sampling strategy to enhance prompt variety. The effectiveness of DREAM is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of T2I models and safety filters in terms of both prompt success rate and diversity.

Existing benchmarks such as JailBreakV-28K, MM-SafetyBench, and HADES provide valuable insights into multi-modal vulnerabilities, but they typically focus on limited attack scenarios, lack standardized defense evaluation, and offer no unified, reproducible toolbox. To address these gaps, we introduce OmniSafeBench-MM, which is a comprehensive toolbox for multi-modal jailbreak attack-defense evaluation. OmniSafeBench-MM integrates 13 representative attack methods, 15 defense strategies, and a diverse dataset spanning 9 major risk domains and 50 fine-grained categories, structured across consultative, imperative, and declarative inquiry types to reflect realistic user intentions. Beyond data coverage, it establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol measuring (1) harmfulness, distinguished by a granular, multi-level scale ranging from low-impact individual harm to catastrophic societal threats, (2) intent alignment between responses and queries, and (3) response detail level, enabling nuanced safety-utility analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 open-source and 8 closed-source MLLMs to reveal their vulnerability to multi-modal jailbreak. By unifying data, methodology, and evaluation into an open-source, reproducible platform, OmniSafeBench-MM provides a standardized foundation for future research.

These sums emerge in the study of the doubling method of Piatetski-Shapiro--Rallis and Lapid--Rallis. For general linear groups, we express these non-abelian Jacobi sums in terms of Kondo's non-abelian Gauss sums. For classical groups and for characters that are not conjugate-dual, we give an explicit formula for these non-abelian Jacobi sums in terms of Gauss sums attached to the Deligne--Lusztig data of the representation, and we prove that these Jacobi sums are constant on geometric Lusztig series. Our results rely on a multiplicativity result of non-abelian Jacobi sums obtained by Girsch--Zelingher.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06588v1\n    "}}

The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v3\n    "}}

This paper presents a longitudinal analysis of attacker behavior using HoneyTrap, an adaptive honeypot framework deployed across geographically distributed nodes to emulate vulnerable services and safely capture malicious traffic. Over a 24 day observation window, more than 60.3 million events were collected. To enable scalable analytics, raw JSON logs were transformed into Apache Parquet, achieving 5.8 - 9.3x compression and 7.2x faster queries, while ASN enrichment and salted SHA-256 pseudonymization added network intelligence and privacy preservation.\n  Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) The majority of traffic targeted HTTP and HTTPS services (ports 80 and 443), with more than 8 million connection attempts and daily peaks exceeding 1.7 million events. (2) SSH (port 22) was frequently subject to brute-force attacks, with over 4.6 million attempts. (3) Less common services like Minecraft (25565) and SMB (445) were also targeted, with Minecraft receiving about 118,000 daily attempts that often coincided with spikes on other ports.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06557v1\n    "}}

However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap. Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation. This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety. DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06556v1\n    "}}

This paper proposes BEACON, a unified dual-dimension framework that integrates behavioral psychology with the tactical lifecycle of cybercrime to enable structured, interpretable, and scalable analysis of cybercrime. We formalize six psychologically grounded manipulation categories derived from Prospect Theory and Cialdini's principles of persuasion, alongside a fourteen-stage cybercrime tactical lifecycle spanning reconnaissance to final impact. A single large language model is fine-tuned using parameter-efficient learning to perform joint multi-label classification across both psychological and tactical dimensions while simultaneously generating human-interpretable explanations. Experiments conducted on a curated dataset of real-world and synthetically augmented cybercrime narratives demonstrate a 20 percent improvement in overall classification accuracy over the base model, along with substantial gains in reasoning quality measured using ROUGE and BERTScore. The proposed system enables automated decomposition of unstructured victim narratives into structured behavioral and operational intelligence, supporting improved cybercrime investigation, case linkage, and proactive scam detection.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06555v1\n    "}}

Decoupled loss improves coupled-loss style of algorithms' (e.g., PPO, GRPO) learning stability by introducing a proximal policy to decouple the off-policy corrections (importance weight) from the controlling policy updates (trust region). However, the proximal policy requires an extra forward pass through the network at each training step, creating a computational bottleneck for large language models. We observe that since the proximal policy only serves as a trust region anchor between the behavior and target policies, we can approximate it through simple interpolation without explicit computation.

Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal safeguards, yet existing DP-enabled DFL methods operate as black-boxes that cannot track cumulative noise added across clients and rounds, forcing each participant to inject worst-case perturbations that severely degrade accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, a new explainable and privacy-preserving framework that addresses this gap by combining a HyperDimensional Computing (HD) model with a transparent DP noise accountant tailored to decentralized learning. HD offers structured, noise-tolerant high-dimensional representations, while the accountant explicitly tracks cumulative perturbations so each client adds only the minimal incremental noise required to satisfy its (epsilon, delta) budget. This yields significantly tighter and more interpretable privacy-utility tradeoffs than prior DP-DFL approaches. Experiments on MNIST (image), ISOLET (speech), and UCI-HAR (wearable sensor) show that PrivateDFL consistently surpasses centralized DP-SGD and Renyi-DP Transformer and deep learning baselines under both IID and non-IID partitions, improving accuracy by up to 24.4% on MNIST, over 80% on ISOLET, and 14.7% on UCI-HAR, while reducing inference latency by up to 76 times and energy consumption by up to 36 times. These results position PrivateDFL as an efficient and trustworthy solution for privacy-sensitive pattern recognition applications such as healthcare, finance, human-activity monitoring, and industrial sensing. Future work will extend the accountant to adversarial participation, heterogeneous privacy budgets, and dynamic topologies.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10691v2\n    "}}

However, most existing defenses focus on secure boot or REE-side monitoring and provide little visibility into the runtime integrity of the TEE. This leaves TrustZone-based devices exposed to persistent TEE compromises. We propose Policy-Driven Runtime Integrity Measurement and Attestation (PDRIMA), a runtime integrity protection approach for TrustZone-based TEEs. PDRIMA systematically analyzes TEE attack surfaces and introduces two in-TEE subsystems: a Secure Monitor Agent (SMA) that performs policy-driven measurement, appraisal, logging, and time-based re-measurement over the TEE kernel, static components, user-TAs, and security-critical system calls; and a Remote Attestation Agent (RAA) that aggregates tamper-evident evidence and exposes a remote attestation protocol for verifying. We analyze PDRIMA's security against identified attack surfaces, implement a prototype on OP-TEE for Raspberry Pi 3B+, and evaluate its performance overhead to indicate its practicability.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06500v1\n    "}}

As sensing emerges as a key feature toward 6G standardization, supporting Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) with limited bandwidth and piggybacking on communication signals, while maintaining high reliability and performance, remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we provide two key contributions. First, we present a programmable, plug-and-play framework for processing PHY/MAC signals through real-time, GPU-accelerated Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications on the edge Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure. Building on the Open RAN dApp architecture, the framework interfaces with a GPU-accelerated gNB based on NVIDIA ARC-OTA, feeding PHY/MAC data to custom AI logic with latency under 0.5 ms for complex channel state information extraction. Second, we demonstrate the framework's capabilities through cuSense, an indoor localization dApp that consumes uplink DMRS channel estimates, removes static multipath components, and runs a neural network to infer the position of a moving person. Evaluated on a 3GPP-compliant 5G NR deployment, cuSense achieves a mean localization error of 77 cm, with 75% of predictions falling within 1 meter. This is without dedicated sensing hardware or modifications to the RAN stack or signals. We plan to release both the framework and cuSense pipelines as open source, providing a reference design for future AI-native RANs and ISAC applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06493v1\n    "}}

While most existing attacks exploit ML techniques for discovering such traffic patterns, they underperform on wireless traffic, especially Wi-Fi, due to its heavy noisiness and the packet loss of wireless sniffing. In addition, these approaches commonly target distinguishing chunked IoT event traffic samples, and they fail at effectively tracking multiple events simultaneously. In this work, we propose WiFinger, a fine-grained multi-IoT event fingerprinting approach against noisy traffic. WiFinger turns the traffic pattern classification task into a subsequence matching problem and introduces novel techniques to account for the high time complexity while maintaining high accuracy. In addition, its reliance on training sample volumes reduces efforts for any future fingerprint updates. Experiments demonstrate that WiFinger outperforms existing approaches under practical threat models, with an average recall of 89% (v.s. 49% and 46% respectively) and almost zero false positives for various IoT events.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03151v2\n    "}}

Existing scheduling approaches use dedicated bus qubits for routing and separate peripheral ancilla qubit factories for magic state preparation, leading to inefficient resource utilization. With the advent of magic state cultivation, preparation qubits can be placed anywhere within the surface code architecture. We introduce Pure Magic scheduling, which dynamically re-purposes magic state cultivation qubits for routing operations, eliminating dedicated bus infrastructure. By interrupting cultivation when qubits are needed for routing, Pure Magic naturally favors shorter cultivation times while ensuring no ancilla qubit remains idle. Our evaluation across 17 benchmark circuits improves scheduling efficiency by 19% to 223% compared to traditional bus routing and decreases average magic state preparation time by 2.6x to 9.7x. Benefits scale with circuit parallelism, making Pure Magic particularly valuable for highly parallel quantum algorithms. The Pure Magic architecture represents a paradigm shift from static to dynamic, demand-driven scheduling in fault-tolerant quantum architectures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06484v1\n    "}}

To address these challenges, we construct scale and fluctuation-dependent correlation matrices using the multifractal detrended cross-correlation coefficient $\u03c1_r$ that selectively emphasizes fluctuations of different amplitudes. We examine the spectral properties of these detrended correlation matrices and compare them to the spectral properties of the matrices calculated in the same way from synthetic Gaussian and $q$Gaussian signals. Our results show that detrending, heavy tails, and the fluctuation-order parameter $r$ jointly produce spectra, which substantially depart from the random case even under absence of cross-correlations in time series. Applying this framework to one-minute returns of 140 major cryptocurrencies from 2021-2024 reveals robust collective modes, including a dominant market factor and several sectoral components whose strength depends on the analyzed scale and fluctuation order. After filtering out the market mode, the empirical eigenvalue bulk aligns closely with the limit of random detrended cross-correlations, enabling clear identification of structurally significant outliers. Overall, the study provides a refined spectral baseline for detrended cross-correlations and offers a promising tool for distinguishing genuine interdependencies from noise in complex, nonstationary, heavy-tailed systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06473v1\n    "}}

Conventional Pre-Shared Key (PSK) encryption, while efficient, remains vulnerable due to static key reuse, replay attacks, and the lack of key freshness. This paper presents the Dynamic Session Enhanced Key Protocol (DSEKP), a lightweight session-key rekeying framework that derives per-session AES-GCM keys using the HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF-SHA256) and authenticates session establishment through an HMAC proof in a single init-ack exchange. DSEKP was implemented on an ESP32 IoT sensor node and a Raspberry Pi 5 edge server communicating through a Mosquitto MQTT broker, and benchmarked against a static PSK baseline over more than 6,500 encrypted packets per configuration. The results demonstrate nearly identical throughput and reliability, with minimal runtime impact (approximately 27 percent one-time session-establishment latency and 10 percent per-packet payload overhead), while delivering per-session key isolation (assuming the long-term secret remains uncompromised) and built-in replay protection. The PSK baseline and DSEKP datasets are publicly archived on IEEE DataPort to enable full reproducibility and comparative benchmarking. These findings confirm that dynamic symmetric rekeying can substantially strengthen IoT-Edge links with minimal computational and bandwidth cost, offering a practical migration path from static PSK to session-aware and scalable IoT security.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02924v2\n    "}}

This allows to reduce the learning complexity by transmitting only updates to the general model in the server in the form of differences in stochastic gradient descent. FL naturally supports differential privacy but new attacks, so called Data Leakage from Gradient (DLG) have been discovered recently. There has been work on defenses against DLG but there is a lack of foundation and rigorous evaluation of their security. In the current work, we extend existing work on a formal notion of Differential Privacy for Federated Learning distributed dynamic systems and relate it to the notion of the attacker advantage. This formalisation is carried out within the Isabelle Insider and Infrastructure framework (IIIf) allowing the machine supported verification of theory and applications within the proof assistant Isabelle. Satellite swarm systems are used as a motivating use case but also as a validation case study.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06467v1\n    "}}

Going beyond UD-MIS to address generic graphs requires embedding schemes, typically with chains of ancilla atoms, and an interpretation algorithm to map results back to the original problem. However, interpreting approximate solutions obtained with realistic quantum computers proves to be a difficult problem. As a case study, we evaluate the ability of two interpretation strategies to correct errors in the recently introduced Crossing Lattice embedding. We find that one strategy, based on finding the closest embedding solution, leads to very high qualities, albeit at an exponential cost. The second strategy, based on ignoring defective regions of the embedding graph, is polynomial in the graph size, but it leads to a degradation of the solution quality which is prohibitive under realistic assumptions on the defect generation. Moreover, more favorable defect scalings lead to a contradiction with well-known approximability conjectures. Therefore, it is unlikely that a scalable and generic improvement in solution quality can be achieved with Rydberg platforms -- thus moving the focus to heuristic algorithms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22761v2\n    "}}

To meet strict resource constraints, real-world deployment has pushed LLM quantization from 8-bit to 4-bit, 2-bit, and now 1.58-bit. Combined with lookup table (LUT)-based inference, CPUs run these ultra-low-bit LLMs even faster than NPUs, opening new opportunities for ubiquitous on-device intelligence.\n  However, this paper identifies that LUT-based inference underutilizes memory bandwidth during parallel inference, which is required for prefilling, test-time scaling, and other multi-token scenarios. The root cause is the scalar LUT paradigm, which performs repetitive and non-contiguous memory accesses for each token.\n  To solve the issue, we propose vector LUT, a new lookup paradigm that constructs a unified LUT across parallel tokens, and performs a single $1 \\rightarrow N$ lookup per index. To realize it efficiently, we further introduce (1) Vector LUT-Centric Tensor Layout, and (2) Cache-Aware Streamed Lookup techniques. Evaluations on 5 edge devices across 3 LLMs show that Vec-LUT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to $4.2\\times$.

However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity, they are found to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, as we reveal that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau envelope-based reformulation, ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety, while effectively preserving benign generation capability.

KyFrog uses a larger dimension (n = 1024) and a small prime modulus q = 1103, together with narrow error distributions with standard deviations sigma_s = sigma_e = 1.4, to target approximately 2^325 classical and quantum security against state-of-the-art lattice attacks under standard cost models, as estimated using the Lattice Estimator. The price paid for this security margin is an extremely large KEM ciphertext (about 0.5 MiB), while public and secret keys remain in the same ballpark as ML-KEM. We describe the design rationale, parameter search methodology, and implementation details of KyFrog, and we compare its asymptotic security and concrete parameter sizes with the ML-KEM standard.

The solution achieves 96.2% F1-score in threat detection, reduces response latency to 420 ms, and enables adaptive security posture management using multimodal language models like Google's Gemini coupled with LangChain for agent orchestration. Benchmark datasets, such as AWS CloudTrail logs, UCF-Crime video frames, and UrbanSound8K audio clips, show greater performance over standard intrusion detection systems, reducing mean time to respond (MTTR) by 65% and improving situational awareness.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and edge computing place programmable defenses closest to users and bots, making them natural enforcement points for machine-learning (ML) driven inspection, throttling, and isolation. This survey synthesizes the landscape of AI-enhanced defenses deployed at the edge: (i) anomaly- and behavior-based Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) within broader Web Application and API Protection (WAAP), (ii) adaptive DDoS detection and mitigation, (iii) bot management that resists human-mimicry, and (iv) API discovery, positive security modeling, and encrypted-traffic anomaly analysis. We add a systematic survey method, a threat taxonomy mapped to edge-observable signals, evaluation metrics, deployment playbooks, and governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda spanning XAI, adversarial robustness, and autonomous multi-agent defense. Our findings indicate that edge-centric AI measurably improves time-to-detect and time-to-mitigate while reducing data movement and enhancing compliance, yet introduces new risks around model abuse, poisoning, and governance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06390v1\n    "}}

In this work, we conduct the first holistic security analysis of the Unitree Go2 platform and uncover ten cross layer vulnerabilities the \"Ten Sins of Embodied AI Security.\" Using BLE sniffing, traffic interception, APK reverse engineering, cloud API testing, and hardware probing, we identify systemic weaknesses across three architectural layers: wireless provisioning, core modules, and external interfaces. These include hard coded keys, predictable handshake tokens, WiFi credential leakage, missing TLS validation, static SSH password, multilingual safety bypass behavior, insecure local relay channels, weak binding logic, and unrestricted firmware access. Together, they allow adversaries to hijack devices, inject arbitrary commands, extract sensitive information, or gain full physical control.Our findings show that securing embodied AI requires far more than aligning the model itself.

However, in many settings worldwide, health decisions are enacted by multi-actor care networks rather than single users. We present JEEVHITAA, an Android/Flutter system that provides context-sensitive, role-aware sharing and verifiable information flows for care circles. JEEVHITAA ingests platform and device data (via Google Health Connect and BLE connectors), constructs multi-layer user profiles from sensor streams and tiered onboarding, and enforces fine-grained, time-bounded access control across permissioned care graphs. Data are end-to-end encrypted in local stores and during peer sync (Firebase), and provisions are made for document capture by camera or upload as PDF. An integrated retrieval-augmented LLM pipeline (i) produces structured, role-targeted summaries and action plans, (ii) enables users to gather advanced insights on health reports, and (iii) performs evidence-grounded user-relevant verification of arbitrary health content, returning provenance, confidence scores, and source citations. We describe the system architecture, connector abstractions, and security primitives, and evaluate robustness and compatibility using synthetic, ontology-driven simulations and vendor compatibility tests. Finally, we outline plans for longitudinal in-the-wild deployments to measure system performance, the correctness of access control, and the real-world effectiveness of relationship-aware credibility support.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06364v1\n    "}}

Covert communication ensures that an adversary is unable to detect the presence of transmissions, which are concealed in channel noise. We show that a square root law (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical communication: $L_{\\rm EG}\\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method.

Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from a large number of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four phase qubits were sufficient for the computational examples considered in this work), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05010v5\n    "}}

Existing approaches to wireless scheduling for information freshness typically ignore this mix of large and small updates, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we consider a single-hop wireless broadcast network with sources transmitting updates of different sizes to a base station over unreliable links. Some sources send large updates spanning many time slots while others send small updates spanning only a few time slots. Due to medium access constraints, only one source can transmit to the base station at any given time, thus requiring careful design of scheduling policies that takes the sizes of updates into account. First, we derive a lower bound on the achievable Age of Information (AoI) by any transmission scheduling policy. Second, we develop optimal randomized policies that consider both switching and no-switching during the transmission of large updates. Third, we introduce a novel Lyapunov function and associated analysis to propose an AoI-based Max-Weight policy that has provable constant factor optimality guarantees. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed scheduling policies through simulations, which show that our Max-Weight policy achieves near-optimal AoI performance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23658v2\n    "}}

The Camouflage Effect in Insider Trading\n    summary: We consider a Kyle-type model where insider trading takes place among a potentially large population of liquidity traders and is subject to legal penalties. Insiders exploit the liquidity provided by the trading masses to \"camouflage\" their actions and balance expected wealth with the necessary stealth to avoid detection. Under a diverse spectrum of prosecution schemes, we establish the existence of equilibria for arbitrary population sizes and a unique limiting equilibrium. A convergence analysis determines the scale of insider trading by a stealth index $\u03b3$, revealing that the equilibrium can be closely approximated by a simple limit due to diminished price informativeness. Empirical aspects are derived from two calibration experiments using non-overlapping data sets spanning from 1980 to 2018, which underline the indispensable role of a large population in insider trading models with legal risk, along with important implications for the incidence of stealth trading and the deterrent effect of legal enforcement.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06309v1\n    "}}

Voice conversion (VC) techniques process the speech signals of two input speakers and other modalities of auxiliary information such as prompts and emotion tags. It changes para-linguistic features from one to another, while maintaining linguistic contents. Recently, VC models have made rapid advancements in both generation quality and personalization capabilities. These developments have attracted considerable attention for diverse applications, including privacy preservation, voice-print reproduction for the deceased, and dysarthric speech recovery. However, these models only learn non-robust features due to the clean training data. Subsequently, it results in unsatisfactory performances when dealing with degraded input speech in real-world scenarios, including additional noise, reverberation, adversarial attacks, or even minor perturbation. Hence, it demands robust deployments, especially in real-world settings. Although latest researches attempt to find potential attacks and countermeasures for VC systems, there remains a significant gap in the comprehensive understanding of how robust the VC model is under input manipulation. here also raises many questions: For instance, to what extent do different forms of input degradation attacks alter the expected output of VC models? Is there potential for optimizing these attack and defense strategies? To answer these questions, we classify existing attack and defense methods from the perspective of input manipulation and evaluate the impact of degraded input speech across four dimensions, including intelligibility, naturalness, timbre similarity, and subjective perception. Finally, we outline open issues and future directions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06304v1\n    "}}

Recent defenses based on known-answer detection (KAD) scheme have reported near-perfect performance by observing an LLM's output to classify input data as clean or contaminated. KAD attempts to repurpose the very susceptibility to prompt injection as a defensive mechanism. We formally characterize the KAD scheme and uncover a structural vulnerability that invalidates its core security premise. To exploit this fundamental vulnerability, we methodically design an adaptive attack, DataFlip. It consistently evades KAD defenses, achieving detection rates as low as $0\\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with a success rate of $91\\%$, all without requiring white-box access to the LLM or any optimization procedures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05630v3\n    "}}

We introduce an acceleration-based adiabatic criterion, consistent with the adiabatic theorem and Landau-Zener theory, that separates adiabatic and diabatic dynamics across the $(T,v)$ plane. The discrete classification agrees with a continuous mean-squared acceleration scale and correlates with a coherence measure given by the ratio of coherence length to the initial packet width $L_\u03c6(t)/\u03c3_0$. We identify a broad Planckian domain in which the dimensionless diffusivity $\u03b1\\!=\\!Dm/\\hbar$ is of order unity and only weakly depends on the parameters. This domain is more prevalent in diabatic regions and in areas of reduced phase coherence, indicating a dephasing driven crossover from Anderson localization to Planckian diffusion. Using the Einstein relation together with nearly constant $\u03b1$, we directly obtain a low temperature tendency $1/\u03c4_{\\rm tr}\\propto T$, offering a insight to $T$-linear resistivity in strange metals. These results provide a unified picture that links adiabaticity, dephasing, and Planckian diffusion in dynamically disordered quantum-acoustics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06263v1\n    "}}

In this approach, calibrated noise $\\mathbf{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}^M$ is used to obscure the difference vector $f(\\mathbf{x})-f(\\mathbf{x}')$, where $\\mathbf{x}'$ is known as a neighboring dataset. A DP guarantee is obtained by studying the tail probability bound of a privacy loss random variable (PLRV), defined as the Radon-Nikodym derivative between two distributions. When $\\mathbf{n}$ follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, the PLRV is characterized as a specific univariate Gaussian. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to generate $\\mathbf{n}$ by leveraging the fact that the perturbation noise is typically spherically symmetric (i.e., the distribution is rotationally invariant around the origin). The new noise generation scheme allows us to investigate the privacy loss from a geometric perspective and express the resulting PLRV using a product measure, $W\\times U$; measure $W$ is related to a radius random variable controlling the magnitude of $\\mathbf{n}$, while measure $U$ involves a directional random variable governing the angle between $\\mathbf{n}$ and the difference $f(\\mathbf{x})-f(\\mathbf{x}')$. We derive a closed-form moment bound on the product measure to prove $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP. Under the same $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP guarantee, our mechanism yields a smaller expected noise magnitude than the classic Gaussian noise in high dimensions, thereby significantly improving the utility of the noisy result $f(\\mathbf{x})+\\mathbf{n}$. To validate this, we consider convex and non-convex empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems in high dimensional space and apply the proposed product noise to achieve privacy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06253v1\n    "}}

At the same time, real-world deployments almost never serve full-precision models: post-training quantization to INT8 or lower precision is now standard practice for reducing memory and latency. This work asks a simple question: how do existing backdoor defenses behave under standard quantization pipelines? We conduct a systematic empirical study of five representative defenses across three precision settings (FP32, INT8 dynamic, INT4 simulated) and two standard vision benchmarks using a canonical BadNet attack. We observe that INT8 quantization reduces the detection rate of all evaluated defenses to 0% while leaving attack success rates above 99%. For INT4, we find a pronounced dataset dependence: Neural Cleanse remains effective on GTSRB but fails on CIFAR-10, even though backdoors continue to survive quantization with attack success rates above 90%. Our results expose a mismatch between how defenses are commonly evaluated (on FP32 models) and how models are actually deployed (in quantized form), and they highlight quantization robustness as a necessary axis in future evaluations and designs of backdoor defenses.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06243v1\n    "}}

Although compiler and Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions have been introduced to address elements of this issue, the overhead and/or comprehensive applicability have limited broad production deployment. The Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to the ARM AArch64 Instruction Set Architecture is a valuable tool to address memory-safety escapes; when used in synchronous tag-checking mode, MTE provides deterministic detection and prevention of sequential buffer overflow attacks, and probabilistic detection and prevention of exploits resulting from temporal use-after-free pointer programming bugs. The AmpereOne processor, launched in 2024, is the first datacenter processor to support MTE. Its optimized MTE implementation uniquely incurs no memory capacity overhead for tag storage and provides synchronous tag-checking with single-digit performance impact across a broad range of datacenter class workloads. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the complete hardware-software stack, identifying application memory management as the primary remaining source of overhead and highlighting clear opportunities for software optimization. The combination of an efficient hardware foundation and a clear path for software improvement makes the MTE implementation of the AmpereOne processor highly attractive for deployment in production cloud environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17773v2\n    "}}

In this work, we challenge this assumption by introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other membership edges. Our framework flexibly integrates existing membership inference techniques and extends them with trend features. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TrendAttack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN membership inference baselines, exposing a critical privacy vulnerability in current graph unlearning methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00808v2\n    "}}

While there is a body of economic and game-theoretic analysis of CLAMMs, there is negligible work that treats Uniswap v3 at the level of formal state machines amenable to model checking or theorem proving.\n  In this paper we propose a formal modeling approach for Uniswap v3-style CLAMMs using (i) networks of priced timed automata (PTA), and (ii) finite-state transducers (FST) over discrete ticks. Positions are treated as stateful objects that transition only when the pool price crosses the ticks that bound their active range. We show how to encode the piecewise constant-product invariant, fee-growth variables, and tick-crossing rules in a PTA suitable for tools such as UPPAAL, and how to derive a tick-level FST abstraction for specification in TLA+.\n  We define an explicit tick-wise invariant for a discretized, single-tick CLAMM model and prove that it is preserved up to a tight additive rounding bound under fee-free swaps. This provides a formal justification for the \"$\u03b5$-slack\" used in invariance properties and shows how rounding enters as a controlled perturbation. We then instantiate these models in TLA+ and use TLC to exhaustively check the resulting invariants on structurally faithful instances, including a three-tick concentrated-liquidity configuration and a bounded no-rounding-only-arbitrage property in a bidirectional single-tick model. We discuss how these constructions lift to the tick-wise structure of Uniswap v3 via virtual reserves, and how the resulting properties can be phrased as PTA/TLA+ invariants about cross-tick behaviour and rounding safety.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06203v1\n    "}}

The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06176v1\n    "}}

FL can train various models for ITS tasks, notably camera-based Road Condition Classification (RCC), in a privacy-preserving collaborative way. However, opening up to collaboration also opens FL-based RCC systems to adversaries, i.e., misbehaving participants that can launch Targeted Label-Flipping Attacks (TLFAs) and threaten transportation safety. Adversaries mounting TLFAs poison training data to misguide model predictions, from an actual source class (e.g., wet road) to a wrongly perceived target class (e.g., dry road). Existing countermeasures against poisoning attacks cannot maintain model performance under TLFAs close to the performance level in attack-free scenarios, because they lack specific model misbehavior detection for TLFAs and neglect client exclusion after the detection. To close this research gap, we propose DEFEND, which includes a poisoned model detection strategy that leverages neuron-wise magnitude analysis for attack goal identification and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based clustering. DEFEND discards poisoned model contributions in each round and adapts accordingly client ratings, eventually excluding malicious clients. Extensive evaluation involving various FL-RCC models and tasks shows that DEFEND can thwart TLFAs and outperform seven baseline countermeasures, with at least 15.78% improvement, with DEFEND remarkably achieving under attack the same performance as in attack-free scenarios.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06172v1\n    "}}

To meet this challenge, the data engineering field has expanded significantly in recent years in both research and industry. Traditionally, data engineering, Machine Learning, and AI workloads have been run on large clusters within data center environments, requiring substantial investment in hardware and maintenance. With the rise of the public cloud, it is now possible to run large applications across nodes without owning or maintaining hardware. Serverless functions such as AWS Lambda provide horizontal scaling and precise billing without the hassle of managing traditional cloud infrastructure. However, when processing large datasets, users often rely on external storage options that are significantly slower than direct communication typical of HPC clusters. We introduce Cylon, a high-performance distributed data frame solution that has shown promising results for data processing using Python. We describe how we took inspiration from the FMI library and designed a serverless communicator to tackle communication and performance issues associated with serverless functions. With our design, we demonstrate that the performance of AWS Lambda falls below one percent of strong scaling experiments compared to serverful AWS (EC2) and HPCs based on implementing direct communication via NAT Traversal TCP Hole Punching.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12185v2\n    "}}

To mitigate the problem of dataset misuse, this paper explores \\textit{dataset inference}, which aims to detect if a suspect model $\\mathcal{M}$ used a victim dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ in training. Previous research tackles dataset inference by aggregating results of membership inference attacks (MIAs) -- methods to determine whether individual samples are a part of the training dataset. However, restricted by the low accuracy of MIAs, previous research mandates grey-box access to $\\mathcal{M}$ to get intermediate outputs (probabilities, loss, perplexity, etc.) for obtaining satisfactory results. This leads to reduced practicality, as LLMs, especially those deployed for profits, have limited incentives to return the intermediate outputs.\n  In this paper, we propose a new method of dataset inference with only black-box access to the target model (i.e., assuming only the text-based responses of the target model are available). Our method is enabled by two sets of locally built reference models, one set involving $\\mathcal{D}$ in training and the other not. By measuring which set of reference model $\\mathcal{M}$ is closer to, we determine if $\\mathcal{M}$ used $\\mathcal{D}$ for training. Evaluations of real-world LLMs in the wild show that our method offers high accuracy in all settings and presents robustness against bypassing attempts.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03619v3\n    "}}

However, applying them to arbitrary functions (especially internal functions) \\textit{at scale} remains challenging due to the requirement of sophisticated contextual information, such as specification, dependencies, and usage examples. State-of-the-art methods heavily rely on static or incomplete context provisioning, causing failure of generating functional harnesses. Furthermore, LLMs tend to exploit harness validation metrics, producing plausible yet logically useless code. % Therefore, harness generation across large and diverse projects continues to face challenges in reliable compilation, robust code retrieval, and comprehensive validation.\n  To address these challenges, we present HarnessAgent, a tool-augmented agentic framework that achieves fully automated, scalable harness construction over hundreds of OSS-Fuzz targets. HarnessAgent introduces three key innovations: 1) a rule-based strategy to identify and minimize various compilation errors; 2) a hybrid tool pool for precise and robust symbol source code retrieval; and 3) an enhanced harness validation pipeline that detects fake definitions. We evaluate HarnessAgent on 243 target functions from OSS-Fuzz projects (65 C projects and 178 C++ projects). It improves the three-shot success rate by approximately 20\\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 87\\% for C and 81\\% for C++. Our one-hour fuzzing results show that more than 75\\% of the harnesses generated by HarnessAgent increase the target function coverage, surpassing the baselines by over 10\\%. In addition, the hybrid tool-pool system of HarnessAgent achieves a response rate of over 90\\% for source code retrieval, outperforming Fuzz Introspector by more than 30\\%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03420v2\n    "}}

There is simply too much attack surface and too little time and energy to spend analyzing it all. The most effective security researchers are often those who are most skilled at intuitively deciding which part of an expansive attack surface to investigate. We demonstrate that this problem of selecting the most promising option from among many possibilities can be reframed as an information retrieval problem, and solved using document ranking techniques with LLMs performing the heavy lifting as general-purpose rankers. We present SiftRank, a ranking algorithm achieving O(n) complexity through three key mechanisms: listwise ranking using an LLM to order documents in small batches of approximately 10 items at a time; inflection-based convergence detection that adaptively terminates ranking when score distributions have stabilized; and iterative refinement that progressively focuses ranking effort on the most relevant documents. Unlike existing reranking approaches that require a separate first-stage retrieval step to narrow datasets to approximately 100 candidates, SiftRank operates directly on thousands of items, with each document evaluated across multiple randomized batches to mitigate inconsistent judgments by an LLM. We demonstrate practical effectiveness on N-day vulnerability analysis, successfully identifying a vulnerability-fixing function among 2,197 changed functions in a stripped binary firmware patch within 99 seconds at an inference cost of $0.82. Our approach enables scalable security prioritization for problems that are generally constrained by manual analysis, requiring only standard LLM API access without specialized infrastructure, embedding, or domain-specific fine-tuning.

We present AIMNET, a one-of-a-kind DT framework that integrates a built-in-house Internet of Things (IoT)-based continuous sensing network with a physics-based multi-scale weather-gas transport model, that enables high-resolution and real-time simulation and detection of carbon gas emissions. AIMNET features a three-layer system architecture: (i) physical world: custom-built devices for continuous monitoring; (ii) bidirectional information feedback links: intelligent data transmission and reverse control; and (iii) digital twin world: AI-driven analytics for prediction, anomaly detection, and dynamic weather-gas coupled molecule transport modeling. Designed for scalable, energy-efficient deployment in remote environments, AIMNET architecture is realized through a small-scale distributed sensing network over an oil and gas production basin. To demonstrate the high-resolution, fast-responding concept, an equivalent mobile-based emission monitoring network was deployed around a wastewater treatment plant that constantly emits methane plumes. Our preliminary results through which, have successfully captured the methane emission events whose dynamics have been further resolved by the tiered model simulations. This work supports our position that AIMNET provides a promising DT framework for reliable, real-time monitoring and predictive risk assessment.

For pure states, obtained for example from a bipartition at zero temperature, these provide distinct characterizations of the entanglement present between two spatial subregions, while for mixed states (such as at finite temperature) only the LN remains a good entanglement measure. Our focus is on regions that have corners, either adjacent or tip-touching. We first obtain general non-perturbative properties regarding the geometrical dependence of the LN and MI. A close similarity is observed with mutual charge fluctuations, where super-universal angle dependence holds allowing for explicit checks. For the MI, we make stronger statements due to strong subadditivity. We also give ramifications of our general analysis to conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions. We then explicitly verify these properties with integer quantum Hall states. To do so we develop two independent approaches to obtain the fermionic LN, which takes into account Fermi statistics: an overlap-matrix method, and a real-space lattice discretization. At finite temperature, we find a rapid decrease of the LN well inside the cyclotron gap at integer fillings. We further show that the LN decays faster compared to the MI at high temperatures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12819v2\n    "}}

Certified detection ensures the detection of all patched harmful versions of certified samples, which mitigates the failures of empirical defense techniques that could (easily) be compromised. However, existing certified detection methods are ineffective in certifying samples that are misclassified or whose mutants are inconsistently pre icted to different labels. This paper proposes HiCert, a novel masking-based certified detection technique. By focusing on the problem of mutants predicted with a label different from the true label with our formal analysis, HiCert formulates a novel formal relation between harmful samples generated by identified loopholes and their benign counterparts. By checking the bound of the maximum confidence among these potentially harmful (i.e., inconsistent) mutants of each benign sample, HiCert ensures that each harmful sample either has the minimum confidence among mutants that are predicted the same as the harmful sample itself below this bound, or has at least one mutant predicted with a label different from the harmful sample itself, formulated after two novel insights. As such, HiCert systematically certifies those inconsistent samples and consistent samples to a large extent. To our knowledge, HiCert is the first work capable of providing such a comprehensive patch robustness certification for certified detection. Our experiments show the high effectiveness of HiCert with a new state-of the-art performance: It certifies significantly more benign samples, including those inconsistent and consistent, and achieves significantly higher accuracy on those samples without warnings and a significantly lower false silent ratio.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06123v1\n    "}}

However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06081v1\n    "}}
