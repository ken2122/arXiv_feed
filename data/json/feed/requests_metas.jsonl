Estimating the entropy of a quantum state is a basic problem in quantum information. In this paper, we introduce a time-efficient quantum approach to estimating the von Neumann entropy $S(\u03c1)$ and R\u00e9nyi entropy $S_\u03b1(\u03c1)$ of an $N$-dimensional quantum state $\u03c1$, given access to independent samples of $\u03c1$. Specifically, we provide the following:\n  1. A quantum estimator for $S(\u03c1)$ with time complexity $\\tilde O(N^2)$, improving the prior best time complexity $\\tilde O(N^6)$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright (2016).\n  2. A quantum estimator for $S_\u03b1(\u03c1)$ with time complexity $\\tilde O(N^{4/\u03b1-2})$ for $0<\u03b1<1$ and $\\tilde O(N^{4-2/\u03b1})$ for $\u03b1>1$, improving the prior best time complexity $\\tilde O(N^{6/\u03b1})$ for $0<\u03b1<1$ and $\\tilde O(N^6)$ for $\u03b1>1$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), though at a cost of a slightly larger sample complexity.\n  Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case. We also provide a sample lower bound for estimating $S_\u03b1(\u03c1)$.\n  Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones that are based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. At the heart of our construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can \"samplize\" a quantum query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples of quantum states; this suggests a unified framework for estimating quantum entropies. Specifically, when a quantum oracle $U$ block-encodes a mixed quantum state $\u03c1$, any quantum query algorithm using $Q$ queries to $U$ can be samplized to a $\u03b4$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using $\\tilde\u0398(Q^2/\u03b4)$ samples of $\u03c1$. Moreover, this samplization is proven to be optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09947v3\n    "}}

Current state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $\u03b1> 0$ and $t\\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\\log^{2+2\u03b1}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\\log(n)\\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \\log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA 2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\\times$ theirs for $t$ as large as $2^{24}$.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15018v2\n    "}}

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01983v1\n    "}}

Quantum computers were coined as a root to facilitate training, but no experimental evidence has been presented so far. Here we demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states. We found that this quantum training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a clearly higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05244v2\n    "}}

For example, fast convolution structures using Cook-Toom and Winograd algorithms are well understood. Short length fast convolutions can be iterated to obtain fast convolution structures for long lengths. In this paper, we show that well known fast convolution structures form the basis for design of fast algorithms in four other problem domains: fast parallel filters, fast polynomial modular multiplication, and fast pointwise multiplication in the DFT and NTT domains. Fast polynomial modular multiplication and fast pointwise multiplication problems are important for cryptosystem applications such as post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption. By establishing the equivalence of these problems, we show that a fast structure from one domain can be used to design a fast structure for another domain. This understanding is important as there are many well known solutions for fast convolution that can be used in other signal processing and cryptosystem applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01974v1\n    "}}

Our starting point is a Chebyshev representation of the call price surface on a warped log-moneyness/maturity rectangle, together with linear sampling and no-arbitrage operators acting on a collocation grid. Static no-arbitrage requirements are enforced as linear inequalities, while the surface is fitted directly to prices via a coverage-seeking quadratic objective that trades off squared band misfit against spectral and transport-inspired regularisation of the Chebyshev coefficients. This yields a strictly convex quadratic program in the modal coefficients, solvable at practical scales with off-the-shelf solvers (OSQP).\n  On top of the global backbone, we introduce a local post-fit layer based on a discrete fog of risk-neutral densities on a three-dimensional lattice (m,t,u) and an associated Hamiltonian-type energy. On each patch of the (m,t) plane, the fog variables are coupled to a nodal price field obtained from the baseline surface, yielding a joint convex optimisation problem that reweights noisy quotes and applies noise-aware local corrections while preserving global static no-arbitrage and locality.\n  The method is designed such that for equity options panels, the combined procedure achieves high inside-spread coverage in stable regimes (in calm years, 98-99% of quotes are priced inside the bid-ask intervals) and low rates of static no-arbitrage violations (below 1%). In stressed periods, the fog layer provides a mechanism for controlled leakage outside the band: when local quotes are mutually inconsistent or unusually noisy, the optimiser allocates fog mass outside the bid-ask tube and justifies small out-of-band deviations of the post-fit surface, while preserving a globally arbitrage-free and well-regularised description of the option surface.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01967v1\n    "}}

As OT systems increasingly integrate with Information Technology (IT) systems due to Industry 4.0 initiatives, they become more vulnerable to cyberattacks, which pose risks not only to data but also to physical infrastructure. The study examines key components of OT systems, such as SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), and RTUs (Remote Terminal Units), and analyzes recent cyberattacks targeting OT environments. Furthermore, it highlights the security concerns arising from the convergence of IT and OT systems, examining attack vectors and the growing threats posed by malware, ransomware, and nation-state actors. Finally, the paper discusses modern approaches and tools used to secure these environments, providing insights into improving the cybersecurity posture of OT networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14017v2\n    "}}

Business requirements and resource constraints often necessitate mixing different languages across replica sites. To facilitate the management of replicated data, modern software engineering practices integrate special-purpose replicated data libraries (RDLs) that provide read-write access to the data and ensure its synchronization. Irrespective of the implementation languages, an RDL typically uses a single language or offers bindings to a designated one. Hence, integrating existing RDLs in multilingual environments requires special-purpose code, whose software quality and performance characteristics are poorly understood.\n  AIMS: We aim to bridge this knowledge gap to understand the software quality and performance characteristics of RDL integration in multilingual environments.\n  METHOD: We conduct an empirical study of two key strategies for integrating RDLs in the context of multilingual replicated data systems: foreign-function interface (FFI) and a common data format (CDF); we measure and compare their respective software metrics and performance to understand their suitability for the task at hand.\n  RESULTS: Our results reveal that adopting CDF for cross-language interaction offers software quality, latency, memory consumption, and throughput advantages. We further validate our findings by (1) creating a CDF-based RDL for mixing compiled, interpreted, and managed languages; and (2) enhancing our RDL with plug-in extensibility that enables adding functionality in a single language while maintaining integration within a multilingual environment.\n  CONCLUSIONS: With modern distributed systems utilizing multiple languages, our findings provide novel insights for designing RDLs in multilingual replicated data systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22010v2\n    "}}

However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator.

Generative Artificial Intelligence offers an interesting opportunity, but empirical evidence on its instructional efficacy remains scarce. This paper provides an experimental validation of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous engines for generating phishing resilience training. Across two controlled studies (N=480), we demonstrate that AI-generated content yields significant pre-post learning gains regardless of the specific prompting strategy employed. Study 1 (N=80) compares four prompting techniques, finding that even a straightforward \"direct-profile\" strategy--simply embedding user traits into the prompt--produces effective training material. Study 2 (N=400) investigates the scalability of this approach by testing personalization and training duration. Results show that complex psychometric personalization offers no measurable advantage over well-designed generic content, while longer training duration provides a modest boost in accuracy. These findings suggest that organizations can leverage LLMs to generate high-quality, effective training at scale without the need for complex user profiling, relying instead on the inherent capabilities of the model.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01893v1\n    "}}

Previous VN studies have primarily focused on factors under the control of reporters, such as sender reputation, email formatting, and communication channels. Despite these efforts, remediation rates for vulnerability notifications continue to remain consistently low. This paper presents the first in-depth study of how HPOs process vulnerability notifications internally and what organizational and operational factors influence VN effectiveness. We examine the problem from a different perspective to provide the first detailed understanding of the reasons behind persistently low remediation rates. Instead of manipulating parameters of VN campaigns, we interview hosting providers directly, investigating how they handle vulnerability notifications and what factors may influence VN effectiveness, such as VN awareness and reachability, HPOs' service models, and perceived security risks.\n  We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 HPOs across shared hosting and web development services, representing varied company sizes and operator roles. Our findings reveal practical insights on VN processing and abuse workflows. While some providers remain hard to reach due to complex infrastructures, most report routinely handling VNs. However, limited remediation often stems from strict responsibility boundaries, where web application issues are seen as the customer's domain. Low hosting fees and high volumes of daily compromises further discourage both proactive and reactive measures. Our findings show that HPOs blame negligent website owners, and prior works on website owners confirms they often undervalue their sites or lack security know-how.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01891v1\n    "}}

For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present Calgacus, a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20075v4\n    "}}

Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $\u03c7^{(2)}$--$\u03c7^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|\u03c7^{(4)}|$ and $|\u03c7^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude. We trace this enhancement to flat bands and strongly bound Frenkel excitons with ferroelectrically aligned out-of-plane dipoles. Building on experimentally demonstrated 1$\\times N$ integrated beam splitters with arbitrary power ratios, we propose an on-chip architecture where each output arm hosts an Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ patch, optionally gated by graphene to tune the complex $n$-photon amplitudes. Using the ab-initio $\u03c7^{(3)}$ and $\u03c7^{(4)}$ values, we predict that three-photon GHZ$_3$ and four-photon cluster-state sources in this platform can achieve $n$-photon generation rates up to $\\sim 10^8$ and $\\sim 10^6$ times larger, respectively, than silica-fiber- and MoS$_2$-based implementations with comparable geometry. We derive the quantum Hamiltonian and explicit $n$-photon generation rates for this platform, and show how suitable interferometric networks enable electrically and spectrally tunable GHZ, $W$, and cluster states based on genuine high-order nonlinear processes in a 2D excitonic Mott insulator.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01874v1\n    "}}

This technology can for example superimpose faces and voices onto videos, creating hyper-realistic but artificial representations. Deepfakes pose significant risks regarding misinformation and fake news, because they can spread false information by depicting public figures saying or doing things they never did, undermining public trust. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages BLS signatures (Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham 2004) to implement signatures that remain valid after image cropping, but are invalidated in all the other types of manipulation, including deepfake creation. Our approach does not require who crops the image to know the signature private key or to be trusted in general, and it is O(1) in terms of signature size, making it a practical solution for scenarios where images are disseminated through web servers and cropping is the primary transformation. Finally, we adapted the signature scheme for the JPEG standard, and we experimentally tested the size of a signed image.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01845v1\n    "}}

This state of affairs impedes scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level reasoning. More abstract and expressive quantum programming constructs are needed. To this end, we introduce a simple syntax for generating unitaries from \"just a phase\"; we combine a (global) phase operation that captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue of the \"if let\" construct that captures subspace selection via pattern matching. This minimal language lifts the focus from gates to eigendecomposition, conjugation, and controlled unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design. We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our language in several ways. Firstly, we establish that our representation is universal by deriving a universal quantum gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum algorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search algorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give clean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics. Finally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of our language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to these semantics. Collectively, these contributions show that this construct offers a principled and practical step toward more abstract and structured quantum programming.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11676v2\n    "}}

We demonstrate that, under some commonly satisfied technical conditions, an appropriate generalization can achieve super-quadratic speedups not only over unstructured search but also over a classical optimization algorithm that searches for the optimum by drawing samples from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. We employ this framework to obtain algorithms for problems including variants of Max Bisection, Max Independent Set, and finding the ground states of the Antiferromagnetic Ising Model and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model, whose runtimes are asymptotically faster than those obtainable with previous short path techniques.

The protocol relies on Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRFs) combined with domain-specific transformations, ensuring that each IdP generates independent pseudonymous identifiers derived from a shared cryptographic service while maintaining full input confidentiality. A central authority maintains a blind registry that records successful and failed identity verifications using only pseudonymous identifiers, allowing global consistency checks without exposing sensitive information or linking users across domains. The proposed construction provides a general and abstract framework suitable for a wide range of federated authentication systems, achieving strong privacy guarantees while supporting effective fraud-prevention mechanisms during identity registration.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01832v1\n    "}}

This paper presents a Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) framework that utilizes informal public transportation systems, such as minibus taxis, as mobile data mules to enhance connectivity in these underserved regions. We develop a probabilistic model to capture the randomness in vehicle mobility, including travel times and contact durations at bus stops. Key performance metrics are analyzed, including average data transmission rate and Peak Age of Information (PAoI), to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system. An analytical approximation for the Mean PAoI (MPAoI) is derived and validated through simulations. Case studies from real-world datasets in Nouakchott, Accra, and Addis Ababa demonstrate the practical applicability and scalability of our framework. The findings indicate that leveraging existing transportation networks can significantly bridge the digital divide by providing reliable internet-like connectivity to remote areas.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01829v1\n    "}}

In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07356v3\n    "}}

This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01824v1\n    "}}

Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-N\u00e9el state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01815v1\n    "}}

After all computations are performed on the encrypted data, it can be decrypted to reveal the result. The decrypted value matches the result that would have been obtained if the same computations were applied to the plaintext data.\n  FHE supports basic operations such as addition and multiplication on encrypted numbers. Using these fundamental operations, more complex computations can be constructed, including subtraction, division, logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, NAND, MUX), and even advanced mathematical functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and trigonometric functions (e.g., sin, cos). These functions can be implemented either as exact formulas or as approximations, depending on the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy.\n  FHE enables privacy-preserving machine learning by allowing a server to process the client's data in its encrypted form through an ML model. With FHE, the server learns neither the plaintext version of the input features nor the inference results. Only the client, using their secret key, can decrypt and access the results at the end of the service protocol. FHE can also be applied to confidential blockchain services, ensuring that sensitive data in smart contracts remains encrypted and confidential while maintaining the transparency and integrity of the execution process. Other applications of FHE include secure outsourcing of data analytics, encrypted database queries, privacy-preserving searches, efficient multi-party computation for digital signatures, and more.\n  This book is an open project (https://fhetextbook.github.io), please report any bugs or errors to the Github issues board.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05136v20\n    "}}

In particular, modeling two-dimensional systems with realistic long-range interactions, in addition to dissipation, is of vital importance to the development of modern quantum computing and simulation platforms. In this paper, we present a construction of the time-evolution operator, as a projected entangled pair operator (denoted tePEPO), that can be used to evolve a tensor network ansatz through time. Interactions beyond nearest-neighbor, including interactions between sites not collinear in the lattice, can be represented efficiently as a tePEPO. Furthermore, we obtain approximations to realistic radial long-range interactions decaying with a power-law, that give accurate results with small tePEPO bond dimension. Finally, we consider a physical example of a Rydberg atom Hamiltonian with long-range dipolar interactions, and show evidence of a dipole-dipole blockading effect in presence of dissipation. This work demonstrates the applicability of tensor networks to two-dimensional systems widely studied in experiments, but previously inaccessible to non-semi-classical methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01781v1\n    "}}

Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01778v1\n    "}}

The implementation processes Paraver traces postmortem, reconstructing critical execution paths and handling common event anomalies, such as clock inconsistencies and unmatched MPI events, to robustly calculate metrics for each segment. The calculated per-window metric values expose transient performance bottlenecks that the timeaggregated metrics from existing tools may conceal. Evaluations on a synthetic benchmark and real-world applications (LaMEM and ls1-MarDyn) demonstrate how time-resolved metrics reveal localised performance bottlenecks obscured by global aggregates, offering a lightweight and scalable alternative even when trace visualisation is impractical.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01764v1\n    "}}

The method uses heat kernel coefficients from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware similarity measures that capture the structure of diverse medical data. The framework is presented through the heat kernel distance (HKD) transformation, which has convergence guarantees. Two algorithms have been developed: The first, Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (HK-MVFC), is used for central analysis. The second, Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC), is used for secure, privacy-preserving learning across hospitals. FedHK-MVFC uses differential privacy and secure aggregation to enable HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic cardiovascular patient datasets demonstrate increased clustering accuracy, reduced communication, and retained efficiency compared to centralized methods. After being validated on 10,000 synthetic patient records across two hospitals, the methods proved useful for collaborative phenotyping involving electrocardiogram (ECG) data, cardiac imaging data, and behavioral data. The proposed methods' theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence, adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols.

This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of artificial intelligence approaches for cybersecurity protection in nuclear infrastructure, using Argonne National Laboratory's Mechanisms Engineering Test Loop (METL) as an experimental platform. We developed a systematic evaluation framework encompassing four machine learning detection paradigms: Change Point Detection, LSTM-based Anomaly Detection, Dependency Violation analysis, and Autoencoder reconstruction methods. Our comprehensive attack taxonomy includes 15 distinct scenarios targeting reactor control systems, each implemented across five severity tiers to evaluate detection performance under varying attack intensities. The experimental evaluation encompassed 300 rigorous experiments using realistic METL operational data. Change Point Detection emerged as the leading approach with mean AUC performance of 0.785, followed by LSTM Anomaly Detection (0.636), Dependency Violation (0.621), and Autoencoder methods (0.580). Attack detectability varied significantly, with multi-site coordinated attacks proving most detectable (AUC = 0.739) while precision trust decay attacks presented the greatest detection challenge (AUC = 0.592).

While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X.

Some of our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12515v2\n    "}}

The extracted features play a critical role in malware analysis. Traditional feature extraction is based on human domain knowledge, while there is a trend of using natural language processing (NLP) for automatic feature extraction. This raises a question: how do we effectively select features for malware analysis based on API call sequences? To answer it, this paper presents a comprehensive study of investigating the impact of feature engineering upon malware classification.We first conducted a comparative performance evaluation under three models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer, with respect to knowledge-based and NLP-based feature engineering methods. We observed that models with knowledge-based feature engineering inputs generally outperform those using NLP-based across all metrics, especially under smaller sample sizes. Then we analyzed a complete set of data features from API call sequences, our analysis reveals that models often focus on features such as handles and virtual addresses, which vary across executions and are difficult for human analysts to interpret.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01666v1\n    "}}

This conclusion is based on our first contribution, which is a state-of-the-art review and categorization of cybersecurity ontologies using the Framework for Ontologies Classification framework. To address this gap, we propose a revised framework for assessing credibility, introducing indicators such as institutional support, academic recognition, day-to-day practitioner validation, and industrial adoption. Based on these new credibility indicators, we construct a classification scheme designed to guide the selection of ontologies that are relevant to specific security needs. We then apply this framework to a concrete use case: the Franco-Luxembourgish research project ANCILE, which illustrates how a credibility-aware evaluation can reshape ontology selection for operational contexts.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01651v1\n    "}}

As graphs get larger, the irregular access patterns exhibited in most graph algorithms, hamper performance. This, along with NUMA and physical memory limits, results in scaling complexities with sequential/shared memory frameworks. StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs. We applied our optimization logic to StarPlat's distributed backend and outperformed d-Galois by 2.05 and DRONE by 1.44 times in Single Source Shortest Paths across several big data graphs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01646v1\n    "}}

Stochastic simulations using the positive-P method allow us to calculate occupations and second order correlations exactly for extended lattices. We use this to optimise the parameters for the possible observation of this effect in polariton micropillar experiments.

These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.\n  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput. Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD) scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.\n  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01002v2\n    "}}

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) on the in-vehicle Ethernet layer is dedicated to ensure deterministic communication between critical services; its Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) supports dynamic resource reservations. However, the dynamic nature of service deployment challenges network resource configuration, since any new reservation may change the latency of already validated flows. Standard methods of worst-case latency analysis for CBS have been found incorrect, and current TSN stream reservation procedures lack mechanisms to signal application layer Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements or verify deadlines. In this paper, we propose and validate a QoS negotiation scheme that interacts with the TSN network controller to reserve resources while ensuring latency bounds. For the first time, this work comparatively evaluates reservation schemes using worst-case analysis and simulations of a realistic In-Vehicle Network (IVN) and demonstrates their impact on QoS guarantees, resource utilization, and setup times. We find that only one reservation scheme utilizing per-queue delay budgets and network calculus provides valid configurations and guarantees acceptable latency bounds throughout the IVN. The proposed service negotiation mechanism efficiently establishes 450 vehicular network reservations in just 11ms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05793v3\n    "}}

However, mobile devices typically have limited and heterogeneous computational capabilities, and different devices may even have different tasks. This client heterogeneity is a major bottleneck hindering the practical application of FL. Existing work mainly focuses on mitigating FL's computation and communication overhead of a single task while overlooking the computing resource heterogeneity issue of different devices in FL. To tackle this, we design FedAPTA, a federated multi-task learning framework. FedAPTA overcomes computing resource heterogeneity through the developed layer-wise model pruning technique, which reduces local model size while considering both data and device heterogeneity. To aggregate structurally heterogeneous local models of different tasks, we introduce a heterogeneous model recovery strategy and a task-aware model aggregation method that enables the aggregation through infilling local model architecture with the shared global model and clustering local models according to their specific tasks. We deploy FedAPTA on a realistic FL platform and benchmark it against nine SOTA FL methods. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed FedAPTA considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art FL methods by up to 4.23\\%.

However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a novel resource-efficient learning framework is introduced for beam prediction, which leverages a custom-designed cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD) algorithm specifically tailored for beam prediction tasks, to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a radar-only student model, achieving high accuracy with reduced computational cost. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05187v2\n    "}}

In HSS-enabled applications such as secure multi-party computation (MPC), security requires that the output shares leak no more information about the inputs than the function output. Such security is ensured by the context-hiding property of HSS. The typical rerandomization technique achieves context hiding but increases the share size. To address this, we formalize the context-hiding property of HSS for individual functions, examine the context-hiding property of Shamir-based HSS for monomials, and extend the study to polynomials.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01604v1\n    "}}

In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01596v1\n    "}}

Additionally, it detects privacy-violating behaviours, automatically responding by supplying spoofed data instead of the user's real data, without crashing or disrupting the apps. Unlike prior approaches, WhiteLie requires neither device rooting nor altering the app's binary, making it deployable on stock Android devices. Through experiments on more than 70 popular Android apps, we demonstrate that WhiteLie is able to deceive apps into accepting spoofed data without getting detected. Our evaluation further demonstrates that WhiteLie introduces negligible overhead in terms of battery usage, CPU consumption, and app execution latency. Our findings underscore the feasibility of implementing user-centric privacy-enhancing mechanisms within the existing Android ecosystem.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01595v1\n    "}}

While they provide strong isolation guarantees, existing CVM architectures lack first-class mechanisms for inter-CVM data sharing due to their disjoint memory model, making inter-CVM data exchange a performance bottleneck in compartmentalized or collaborative multi-CVM systems. Under this model, a CVM's accessible memory is either shared with the hypervisor or protected from both the hypervisor and all other CVMs. This design simplifies reasoning about memory ownership; however, it fundamentally precludes plaintext data sharing between CVMs because all inter-CVM communication must pass through hypervisor-accessible memory, requiring costly encryption and decryption to preserve confidentiality and integrity.\n  In this paper, we introduce CAEC, a system that enables protected memory sharing between CVMs. CAEC builds on Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) and extends its firmware to support Confidential Shared Memory (CSM), a memory region securely shared between multiple CVMs while remaining inaccessible to the hypervisor and all non-participating CVMs. CAEC's design is fully compatible with CCA hardware and introduces only a modest increase (4\\%) in CCA firmware code size. CAEC delivers substantial performance benefits across a range of workloads. For instance, inter-CVM communication over CAEC achieves up to 209$\\times$ reduction in CPU cycles compared to encryption-based mechanisms over hypervisor-accessible shared memory. By combining high performance, strong isolation guarantees, and attestable sharing semantics, CAEC provides a practical and scalable foundation for the next generation of trusted multi-CVM services across both edge and cloud environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01594v1\n    "}}

However, related fraud activities, especially phishing scams, have caused significant property losses. There are many graph analysis methods to detect malicious scam incidents, but no research on the transaction patterns of the NFT scams. Therefore, to fill this gap, we are the first to systematically explore NFT phishing frauds through graph analysis, aiming to comprehensively investigate the characteristics and patterns of NFT phishing frauds on the transaction graph. During the research process, we collect transaction records, log data, and security reports related to NFT phishing incidents published on multiple platforms. After collecting, sanitizing, and unifying the data, we construct a transaction graph and analyze the distribution, transaction features, and interaction patterns of NFT phishing scams. We find that normal transactions on the blockchain accounted for 96.71% of all transactions. Although phishing-related accounts accounted for only 0.94% of the total accounts, they appeared in 8.36% of the transaction scenarios, and their interaction probability with normal accounts is significantly higher in large-scale transaction networks. Moreover, NFT phishing scammers often carry out fraud in a collective manner, targeting specific accounts, tend to interact with victims through multiple token standards, have shorter transaction cycles than normal transactions, and involve more multi-party transactions. This study reveals the core behavioral features of NFT phishing scams, providing important references for the detection and prevention of NFT phishing scams in the future.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01577v1\n    "}}

Single-server PIR based on homomorphic encryption has particularly gained immense attention for its ease of deployment and reduced trust assumptions. However, single-server PIR remains impractical due to its high computational and memory bandwidth demands. Specifically, reading the entirety of large databases from storage, such as SSDs, severely limits its performance. To address this, we propose IVE, an accelerator for single-server PIR with a systematic extension that enables practical retrieval from large databases using DRAM. Recent advances in DRAM capacity allow PIR for large databases to be served entirely from DRAM, removing its dependence on storage bandwidth. Although the memory bandwidth bottleneck still remains, multi-client batching effectively amortizes database access costs across concurrent requests to improve throughput. However, client-specific data remains a bottleneck, whose bandwidth requirements ultimately limits performance. IVE overcomes this by employing a large on-chip scratchpad with an operation scheduling algorithm that maximizes data reuse, further boosting throughput. Additionally, we introduce sysNTTU, a versatile functional unit that enhances area efficiency without sacrificing performance. We also propose a heterogeneous memory system architecture, which enables a linear scaling of database sizes without a throughput degradation. Consequently, IVE achieves up to 1,275x higher throughput compared to prior PIR hardware solutions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01574v1\n    "}}

Specifically, vehicles need to exchange information with the road side unit (RSU). However, due to the varying vehicle speeds leading to different communication durations, the amount of data exchanged between different vehicles and the RSU may vary. This may poses significant safety risks in high-speed environments. To address this, we define a fairness index through tuning the selection window of different vehicles and consider the image semantic communication system to reduce latency. However, adjusting the selection window may affect the communication time, thereby impacting the AoI. Moreover, considering the re-evaluation mechanism in 5G NR, which helps reduce resource collisions, it may lead to an increase in AoI. We analyze the AoI using Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) and construct a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve fair access and AoI optimization. Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) is employed to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, and solve it using convex optimization. We also provide a large language model (LLM) based algorithm. The scheme's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01571v1\n    "}}

With the advent of powerful devices in the network edge, Gossip Learning further decentralizes Federated Learning by removing centralized integration and relying fully on peer to peer updates. However, the averaging methods generally used in both Federated and Gossip Learning are not ideal for model accuracy and global convergence. Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes. Overall, it shows strong global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to a linear loss for alternatives under limited connectivity.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01549v1\n    "}}

Despite recent progress in enhancing the effectiveness of MIAs across diverse settings, defense strategies have lagged behind -- struggling to balance model utility with robustness against increasingly sophisticated attacks. In this work, we propose the ideal inversion error to measure the privacy leakage, and our theoretical and empirical investigations reveals that higher-rank features are inherently more prone to privacy leakage. Motivated by this insight, we propose a lightweight and effective defense strategy based on low-rank feature filtering, which explicitly reduces the attack surface by constraining the dimension of intermediate representations. Extensive experiments across various model architectures and datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing defenses, achieving state-of-the-art performance against a wide range of MIAs. Notably, our approach remains effective even in challenging regimes involving high-resolution data and high-capacity models, where prior defenses fail to provide adequate protection.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05814v3\n    "}}

In this setting, minimizing latency requires addressing the tight coupling between model placement and request scheduling across heterogeneous nodes, as suboptimal decisions in one domain can negate benefits in the other. In this paper, we propose Hyperion, a hierarchical two-stage framework that jointly optimizes partitioning and scheduling for pipelined LLM inference. Hyperion minimizes latency by balancing resources across tiers without requiring model retraining or incurring significant runtime overhead. Leveraging the timescale difference between partitioning and request arrivals, Stage 1 performs offline, inter-tier partitioning via a Hyperion Split with Dynamic Programming (HypSplit-DP) procedure to produce balanced stage times under tier capacity and memory constraints; to adapt to time-varying load, Stage 2 performs online, intra-tier scheduling with a lightweight Hyperion Scheduling for Real-Time (HypSched-RT) that maps each request to the best available node using real-time estimates of queue length and effective capacity.

This study presents a comparative analysis of recovery solutions, focusing on systems that operate partially or entirely within cloud environments and assessing their reliability in fulfilling organizational roles securely and dependably. Two such systems were deployed and evaluated in a real-world production setting. Key performance and reliability metrics were identified using simulation software to enhance these systems, alongside a System Dynamics analysis conducted for each. This work proposes a comprehensive framework for selecting and maintaining data protection and recovery solutions within organizational structures, outlining criteria for aligning chosen approaches with operational needs while adhering to predetermined timelines specified in business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The resulting analysis and findings offer actionable insights to guide decision-making when selecting appropriate recovery concepts.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01477v1\n    "}}

Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \\emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \\emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \\emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01454v1\n    "}}

In these intervals, Qubic's average hashrate share rises to the 23-34\\% range, yet sustained 51\\% control is never observed. We evaluate the campaign against the classical selfish mining model and a modified Markov-chain model that reflects Qubic's conservative release strategy: both predict lower revenue than honest mining at the inferred parameters, and the data largely confirms this while still showing noticeable deviations from the predicted curve. We interpret this gap between model and measurements in terms of Qubic's time-varying hashrate and coarse-grained attack segmentation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01437v1\n    "}}

A survey about Secure Shufflers for privacy-preserving computations\n    summary: Ishai et al. (FOCS'06) introduced secure shuffling as an efficient building block for private data aggregation. Recently, the field of differential privacy has revived interest in secure shufflers by highlighting the privacy amplification they can provide in various computations. Although several works argue for the utility of secure shufflers, they often treat them as black boxes; overlooking the practical vulnerabilities and performance trade-offs of existing implementations. This leaves a central question open: what makes a good secure shuffler?\n  This survey addresses that question by identifying, categorizing, and comparing 26 secure protocols that realize the necessary shuffling functionality. To enable a meaningful comparison, we adapt and unify existing security definitions into a consistent set of properties. We also present an overview of privacy-preserving technologies that rely on secure shufflers, offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate protocols, and outline promising directions for future work.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01487v2\n    "}}

It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics.\n  To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages. Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01396v1\n    "}}

To facilitate the malicious activities, they continually register new domain names for exploitation. Previous work revealed an abnormally high concentration of malicious registrations in a handful of domain name registrars and top-level domains (TLDs). Anecdotal evidence suggests that low registration prices attract cybercriminals, implying that higher costs may potentially discourage them. However, no existing study has systematically analyzed the factors driving abuse, leaving a critical gap in understanding how different variables influence malicious registrations. In this report, we carefully distill the inclinations and aversions of malicious actors during the registration of new phishing domain names. We compile a comprehensive list of 73 features encompassing three main latent factors: registration attributes, proactive verification, and reactive security practices. Through a GLM regression analysis, we find that each dollar reduction in registration fees corresponds to a 49% increase in malicious domains. The availability of free services, such as web hosting, drives an 88% surge in phishing activities. Conversely, stringent restrictions cut down abuse by 63%, while registrars providing API access for domain registration or account creation experience a staggering 401% rise in malicious domains. This exploration may assist intermediaries involved in domain registration to develop tailored anti-abuse practices, yet aligning them with their economic incentives.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01391v1\n    "}}

However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01357v1\n    "}}

Existing approaches overwhelmingly operate within the prompt-optimization paradigm: whether through traditional algorithmic search or recent agent-based workflows, the resulting prompts typically retain malicious semantic signals that modern guardrails are primed to detect. In contrast, we identify a deeper, largely overlooked vulnerability stemming from the highly interconnected nature of an LLM's internal knowledge. This structure allows harmful objectives to be realized by weaving together sequences of benign sub-queries, each of which individually evades detection. To exploit this loophole, we introduce the Correlated Knowledge Attack Agent (CKA-Agent), a dynamic framework that reframes jailbreaking as an adaptive, tree-structured exploration of the target model's knowledge base. The CKA-Agent issues locally innocuous queries, uses model responses to guide exploration across multiple paths, and ultimately assembles the aggregated information to achieve the original harmful objective. Evaluated across state-of-the-art commercial LLMs (Gemini2.5-Flash/Pro, GPT-oss-120B, Claude-Haiku-4.5), CKA-Agent consistently achieves over 95% success rates even against strong guardrails, underscoring the severity of this vulnerability and the urgent need for defenses against such knowledge-decomposition attacks.

However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as \"(@_@)\" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01335v1\n    "}}

These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01326v1\n    "}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI)}, a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $\u03a3_K$, and prove a \\textbf{Monotonic Improvement Theorem}, which establishes that maximizing $\u03a3_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$). Collectively, these results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20016v2\n    "}}

This approach examines end-to-end security properties of entire systems, rather than AI models in isolation. While we recognize that hardening a single model is useful, it is important to realize that it is often insufficient. By way of an analogy, creating a model that is always helpful and harmless is akin to creating software that is always helpful and harmless. The collective experience of decades of cybersecurity research and practice shows that this is insufficient. Rather, constructing an informed and realistic attacker model before building a system, applying hard-earned lessons from software security, and continuous improvement of security posture is a tried-and-tested approach to securing real computer systems. A key goal is to examine where research challenges arise when applying traditional security principles in the context of AI agents. A secondary goal of this report is to distill these ideas for AI and ML practitioners and researchers. We discuss the challenges of applying security principles to agentic computing, present 11 case studies of real attacks on agentic systems, and define a series of new research problems specific to the security of agentic systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01295v1\n    "}}

However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects.\n  In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework.\n  We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01255v1\n    "}}

Notably, the bit-flip oracle, capable of flipping the state based on a given classical function, emerges as a fundamental component in the design and construction of quantum algorithms. Devising methods to optimally implement the bit-flip oracle essentially translates to the efficient synthesis of reversible functions. Prior research has primarily focused on the qubit model, leaving the higher dimensional systems, i.e. qudit model, largely unexplored. By allowing more than two computational bases, qudit model can fully utilize the multi-level nature of the underlying physical mechanism. We propose a method to synthesize even permutations in $A_{d^{n}}$ using $\u0398(d)$ $(n - 1)$-qudit sub-circuits, which achieve asymptotic optimality in the count of sub-circuits. Moreover, we introduce a technique for synthesizing reversible functions employing $O\\left( n d^{n} \\right)$ gates and only a single ancilla. This is asymptotically tight in terms of $d$ and asymptotically almost tight in terms of $n$.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05237v2\n    "}}

Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21669v2\n    "}}

However, their immersive and personalized nature, combined with technical vulnerabilities, raises significant safety concerns. Despite their popularity, a systematic evaluation of their safety has been notably absent. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale safety study of AI character platforms, evaluating 16 popular platforms using a benchmark set of 5,000 questions across 16 safety categories. Our findings reveal a critical safety deficit: AI character platforms exhibit an average unsafe response rate of 65.1%, substantially higher than the 17.7% average rate of the baselines. We further discover that safety performance varies significantly across different characters and is strongly correlated with character features such as demographics and personality. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate that our machine learning model is able identify less safe characters with an F1-score of 0.81. This predictive capability can be beneficial for platforms, enabling improved mechanisms for safer interactions, character search/recommendations, and character creation. Overall, the results and findings offer valuable insights for enhancing platform governance and content moderation for safer AI character platforms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01247v1\n    "}}

However, the short duration (typically 24-48 hours) and ephemeral infrastructure of these events often impede sustained educational benefit. Learners face substantial barriers in revisiting unsolved challenges, primarily due to the cumbersome process of manually reconstructing and rehosting the challenges without comprehensive documentation or guidance. To address this critical gap, we introduce CTF Archive, a platform designed to preserve the educational value of CTF competitions by centralizing and archiving hundreds of challenges spanning over a decade in fully configured, ready-to-use environments. By removing the complexity of environment setup, CTF Archive allows learners to focus directly on conceptual understanding rather than technical troubleshooting. The availability of these preserved challenges encourages in-depth research and exploration at the learner's pace, significantly enhancing conceptual comprehension without the pressures of live competition. Additionally, public accessibility lowers entry barriers, promoting an inclusive educational experience. Overall, CTF Archive provides a scalable solution to integrate persistent, practical cybersecurity learning into academic curricula.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01233v1\n    "}}

Although it is known that DD size and processing time vary depending on the variable order in classical circuits, there has not been much research on the variable order under quantum circuit simulation. One existing study pointed out that dynamic reordering worsens the simulation time and numerical accuracy, and there is no comprehensive research on static orders in the context of quantum circuit simulation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scoring-based heuristic method for determining a static variable order that enables efficient DD-based quantum circuit simulation. When applied to benchmark circuits, the default original variable orders resulted in slow simulations, whereas the proposed method achieved speedups of up to 150x. Furthermore, the proposed order completed the simulation of Shor's 1011 factorization in 5 hours on a single-core laptop, although it was not completed within two days previously.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01186v1\n    "}}

However, recent MLLMs integrating images and text remain highly vulnerable to coordinated jailbreaks. Existing defenses primarily focus on the text, lacking robust multi-modal protection. As a result, studies indicate that MLLMs are more susceptible to malicious or unsafe instructions, unlike their text-only counterparts. In this paper, we proposed DefenSee, a robust and lightweight multi-modal black-box defense technique that leverages image variants transcription and cross-modal consistency checks, mimicking human judgment. Experiments on popular multi-modal jailbreak and benign datasets show that DefenSee consistently enhances MLLM robustness while better preserving performance on benign tasks compared to SOTA defenses. It reduces the ASR of jailbreak attacks to below 1.70% on MiniGPT4 using the MM-SafetyBench benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods under the same conditions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01185v1\n    "}}

In this paper, we reconstruct the software architecture and the control models implemented by ArduPilot and then examine how these control models could potentially misused to induce malicious behaviors while relying on legitimate inputs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01164v1\n    "}}

Such a demonstration must be done with respect to the best-known scaling of classical heuristics at a given optimality gap of a given problem. For cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses, recent theoretical and experimental developments open the possibility of showing quantum speedup for approximate optimization with quantum annealing. It is therefore desirable to understand the optimality-gap range over which such a speedup should be searched for. Here we show that on cubic-lattice tile-planting models, classical meta-heuristics that are linear-time by construction can reach optimality gaps at which simulated annealing and parallel tempering exhibit super-linear scaling. This implies that the optimality gaps achieved by linear-time classical meta-heuristics can serve as useful upper bounds for the optimality-gap range over which quantum speedups in approximate optimization should be searched for. We also explain how classical heuristics with fixed scaling that is beyond-cubic can provide upper bounds to optimality-gap ranges for beyond-quadratic quantum speedups in approximate optimization. These results encourage the development of classical heuristics with fixed scaling that achieve optimality gaps as small as possible.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267v7\n    "}}

We introduce Sliced Renyi Pufferfish Privacy (SRPP), which replaces high-dimensional comparisons by directional ones over a set of unit vectors, enabling geometry-aware and tractable guarantees. To calibrate noise without high-dimensional OT, we propose sliced Wasserstein mechanisms that compute per-direction (1-D) sensitivities, yielding closed-form, statistically stable, and anisotropic calibrations. We further define SRPP Envelope (SRPE) as computable upper bounds that are tightly implementable by these sliced Wasserstein mechanisms. For iterative deep learning algorithms, we develop a decompose-then-compose SRPP-SGD scheme with gradient clipping based on a History-Uniform Cap (HUC), a pathwise bound on one-step directional changes that is uniform over optimization history, and a mean-square variant (ms-HUC) that leverages subsampling randomness to obtain on-average SRPP guarantees with improved utility. The resulting HUC and ms-HUC accountants aggregate per-iteration, per-direction Renyi costs and integrate naturally with moments-accountant style analyses. Finally, when multiple mechanisms are trained and privatized independently under a common slicing geometry, our analysis yields graceful additive composition in both worst-case and mean-square regimes. Our experiments indicate that the proposed SRPP-based methods achieve favorable privacy-utility trade-offs in both static and iterative settings.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01115v1\n    "}}

More specifically, using suitable quantifiers, we analyze quantum coherence, mixedness, and entanglement in NMR systems and examine their features within the system. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the quantum elements and show how they depend on temperature and magnetic field strength. We demonstrate that at zero temperature, the system exhibits a quantum critical point, characterized by non-analytic behavior in the measures of coherence, and a sharp peak in mixedness. Moreover, we analyze the entanglement of the system using a suitable entanglement witness. This provides an experimentally friendly setting for testing entanglement in NMR systems. In other words, the witness links the entanglement in the system to quantum observables, making it directly provable in NMR experiments. We establish a connection between quantum information quantifiers and experimentally accessible NMR spectra of the system, enabling the quantification of entanglement, coherence, and mixedness through NMR signal processing.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01100v1\n    "}}

These protocols must coexist within the same frequency bands, leading to mutual interference. This paper investigates the physical-layer impact of two types of narrowband signals (BPSK and GMSK) on LoRa demodulation. We employ symbol-level Monte Carlo simulations to analyse how the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) affects the symbol error rate (SER) at a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise floor, and then compare the results with those for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) of equal power. We demonstrate that modelling narrowband interference as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) systematically overestimates the SER of Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) demodulation. We also clarify the distinct impairment levels induced by AWGN and two types of narrowband interferers, and provide physical insight into the underlying mechanisms. Finally, we fit a two-segment function for the maximum INR that ensures correct demodulation across SNRs, with one segment for low SNR and the other for high SNR.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01088v1\n    "}}

Despite this potential, most existing research still considers the IRS merely as a standalone physical-layer component, controlled by transmitters. However, as networks grow to encompass a massive number of these surfaces and a massive number of transmitters wishing to use them, this transmitter-centric design encounters substantial challenges. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Internet of IRS (IoIRS), an architecture that reconceives the IRS not just as a passive reflecting surface, but as a connected, hybrid entity functioning across both the physical layer and upper network layers. We present the conceptual framework and a preliminary protocol suite necessary to integrate these surfaces into the higher network layers. We conclude by examining how IoIRS architectures could be applied in practice, as their deployment will be essential for fully realizing the capabilities of future wireless networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01083v1\n    "}}

Several attempts have been made to protect individuals from being identified by unauthorized FR systems utilizing adversarial attacks to generate encrypted face images. However, existing methods suffer from poor visual quality or low attack success rates, which limit their utility. Recently, diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in image generation. In this work, we ask: can diffusion models be used to generate adversarial examples to improve both visual quality and attack performance? We propose DiffProtect, which utilizes a diffusion autoencoder to generate semantically meaningful perturbations on FR systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffProtect produces more natural-looking encrypted images than state-of-the-art methods while achieving significantly higher attack success rates, e.g., 24.5% and 25.1% absolute improvements on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13625v4\n    "}}

However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no semantic equivalence or semantic coherence errors compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

Yet today's networking architectures, built on complete decoupling of the applications and the network, cannot expose or exploit high-level goals, limiting their ability to adapt intelligently to service needs. This work introduces Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Semantic Networking (GoAgentNet), a new architecture that elevates communication from data exchange to goal fulfilment. GoAgentNet enables applications and the network to collaborate by abstracting their functions into multiple collaborative agents, and jointly orchestrates multi-agent sensing, networking, computation, and control through semantic computation and cross-layer semantic networking, allowing the entire architecture to pursue unified application goals. We first outline the limitations of legacy network designs in supporting 6G services, based on which we highlight key enablers of our GoAgentNet design. Then, through three representative 6G usage scenarios, we demonstrate how GoAgentNet can unlock more efficient and intelligent services. We further identify unique challenges faced by GoAgentNet deployment and corresponding potential solutions. A case study on robotic fault detection and recovery shows that our GoAgentNet architecture improves energy efficiency by up to 99% and increases the task success rate by up to 72%, compared with the existing networking architectures without GoAgentNet, which underscores its potential to support scalable and sustainable 6G systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01035v1\n    "}}

Understanding and addressing these attacks is crucial for advancing the field of LLM safety. Previous jailbreak approaches have mainly focused on direct manipulations of harmful intent, with limited attention to the impact of persona prompts. In this study, we systematically explore the efficacy of persona prompts in compromising LLM defenses. We propose a genetic algorithm-based method that automatically crafts persona prompts to bypass LLM's safety mechanisms. Our experiments reveal that: (1) our evolved persona prompts reduce refusal rates by 50-70% across multiple LLMs, and (2) these prompts demonstrate synergistic effects when combined with existing attack methods, increasing success rates by 10-20%.

Energy meters are often located in underground spaces that are difficult to reach with wireless technology. This paper presents an experimental study comparing different Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) technologies in terms of building penetration and radio coverage. The technologies Low Power Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWAN), Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT), Sigfox 0G and Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks (Wi-SUN) are evaluated experimentally. It also proposes a distributed hybrid IoT architecture that combines multiple LPWAN technologies using an abstraction layer to optimize cost and coverage. Communication is message-based using the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. It is implemented using the MQTT protocol. The abstraction layer decodes the proprietary binary data and converts it to a normalized JSON format.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00998v1\n    "}}

During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00970v1\n    "}}

This paper introduces a decentralized decoding architecture that fundamentally breaks from the LSFD, by allowing each access point (AP) to calculate interference-suppressing local weights independently and apply them to its data estimates before transmission. Furthermore, two generalized local zero-forcing (ZF) frameworks, generalized partial full-pilot ZF (G-PFZF) and generalized protected weak PFZF (G-PWPFZF), are introduced, where each AP adaptively and independently determines its combining strategy through a local sum spectral efficiency (SE) optimization that classifies user equipments (UEs) as strong or weak, eliminating the fixed thresholds used in the PFZF and PWPFZF schemes. To enhance scalability, pilot-dependent combining vectors instead of user-dependent ones are introduced and are shared among users with the same pilot. The closed-form SE expressions corresponding to the proposed schemes are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes consistently outperform fixed-threshold counterparts, while the introduction of local weights yields lower overheads and computation costs with lower performance penalty compared to them.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17445v2\n    "}}

In this paper, we present IntentGuard, a general defense framework based on instruction-following intent analysis. The key insight of IntentGuard is that the decisive factor in IPIAs is not the presence of malicious text, but whether the LLM intends to follow instructions from untrusted data. Building on this insight, IntentGuard leverages an instruction-following intent analyzer (IIA) to identify which parts of the input prompt the model recognizes as actionable instructions, and then flag or neutralize any overlaps with untrusted data segments. To instantiate the framework, we develop an IIA that uses three \"thinking intervention\" strategies to elicit a structured list of intended instructions from reasoning-enabled LLMs. These techniques include start-of-thinking prefilling, end-of-thinking refinement, and adversarial in-context demonstration. We evaluate IntentGuard on two agentic benchmarks (AgentDojo and Mind2Web) using two reasoning-enabled LLMs (Qwen-3-32B and gpt-oss-20B). Results demonstrate that IntentGuard achieves (1) no utility degradation in all but one setting and (2) strong robustness against adaptive prompt injection attacks (e.g., reducing attack success rates from 100% to 8.5% in a Mind2Web scenario).\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00966v1\n    "}}

However, practical implementation in real-world scenarios is hindered by unstable sensing performance and limited knowledge of wireless sensing coverage. While previous works have aimed to address these challenges, they have overlooked the impact of walls on dynamic sensing capabilities in indoor environments. To fill this gap, we present a theoretical model that accounts for the effect of wall-device distance on sensing coverage. By incorporating both the wall-reflected path and the line-of-sight (LoS) path for dynamic signals, we develop a comprehensive sensing coverage model tailored for indoor environments. This model demonstrates that strategically deploying the transmitter and receiver in proximity to the wall within a specific range can significantly expand sensing coverage. We assess the performance of our model through experiments in respiratory monitoring and stationary crowd counting applications, showcasing a notable 11.2% improvement in counting accuracy. These findings pave the way for optimized deployment strategies in Wi-Fi sensing, facilitating more effective and accurate sensing solutions across various applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13208v4\n    "}}

In these systems, effects such as coherence, entanglement, and non-Markovianity play key roles. In this thesis, we explore different ways to describe quantum thermodynamics, using two main approaches: one based on entropy and the other on ergotropy. First, we introduce a generalized approach to quantify non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity in thermodynamic functions. In this context, the entropy-based heat flow serves as a practical tool to witness and measure quantum memory in unital maps that do not reverse the sign of the internal energy. Next, we analyze the dynamics of ergotropy in open qubits under both Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. We identify phenomena such as freezing and sudden death of ergotropy, and we establish an analytical relation between the change in ergotropy and the environment-induced work . This provides a clear physical interpretation for the additional term in the first law in the entropy-based formulation. Finally, we propose an ergotropy-based thermodynamic formulation, in which heat is reinterpreted in terms of the change of the passive state associated with the density operator governing the quantum dynamics. This approach allows one to measure non-Markovianity of unital maps more generally and accurately than the entropy-based heat flow. This advantage comes from the direct link between heat and von Neumann entropy, a property ensured by invariance under passive transformations. Moreover, the out-of-equilibrium temperature naturally remains non-negative, similarly to equilibrium thermodynamics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00923v1\n    "}}

According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual losses, presenting a massive economic asymmetry: the financial cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the operational cost of a False Positive (manual review) by a ratio of approximately 5,480:1. This paper contrasts two detection paradigms: a Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream (CatBoost), which analyzes linguistic cues like urgency and authority with high interpretability, and a Semantic Stream (DistilBERT), which utilizes deep learning for contextual understanding. We evaluated both streams on a hybrid dataset (N=7,990) containing human-legitimate and AI-synthesized adversarial fraud. Benchmarked on Tesla T4 infrastructure, DistilBERT achieved near-perfect detection on synthetic threats (AUC >0.99, F1 =0.998) with acceptable real-time latency (7.4 ms). CatBoost achieved competitive detection (AUC =0.991, F1 =0.949) at 8.4x lower latency (0.8 ms) with negligible resource consumption. We conclude that while DistilBERT offers maximum accuracy for GPU-equipped organizations, CatBoost provides a viable, cost-effective alternative for edge deployments. Both approaches demonstrate a theoretical ROI exceeding 99.9% when optimized via cost-sensitive learning.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20944v2\n    "}}

However, its high computational and communication demands hinder its deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose SmartFed, a resource-efficient federated fine-tuning framework. SmartFed intelligently reuses knowledge embedded in existing LoRA modules, eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch when adapting LLMs to new tasks. To effectively exploit this knowledge and ensure scalability, we introduce the Mixture of Rank-Wise Experts (MoRE). MoRE decomposes LoRA modules into fine-grained rank-level experts. These experts are selectively activated and combined based on input semantics and resource budgets. Moreover, to optimize resource utilization, we present the Elastic Expert Quota Allocation (EEQA). EEQA adaptively allocates expert capacity across parameter matrices based on their contribution to model performance, focusing computing resources on the critical experts. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SmartFed significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance and training efficiency.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00902v1\n    "}}

Sequencers (system participants) execute transactions within TEEs and upload signed execution results to the blockchain with confidential keys of TEEs. Unlike most TEE-assisted blockchain designs, TEERollup adopts a practical threat model where the integrity and availability of TEEs may be compromised. To address these issues, we first introduce a distributed system of sequencers with heterogeneous TEEs, ensuring system security even if a certain proportion of TEEs are compromised. Second, we propose a challenge mechanism to solve the redeemability issue caused by TEE unavailability. Furthermore, TEERollup incorporates Data Availability Providers (DAPs) to reduce on-chain storage overhead and uses a laziness penalty mechanism to regulate DAP behavior. We implement a prototype of TEERollup in Golang, using the Ethereum test network, Sepolia. Our experimental results indicate that TEERollup outperforms zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), reducing on-chain verification costs by approximately 86% and withdrawal delays to a few minutes.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14647v3\n    "}}

Using structural break analysis, we find that human-driven Ethereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC-20) transactions shifted on November 3, two days before the election, while exchange trading volumes reacted only on Election Day. Automated smart-contract activity adjusted much later, with structural breaks appearing in January 2025. We validate these shifts using surrogate-based robustness tests. Complementary energy-spectrum analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum identifies pronounced post-election turbulence, and a structural vector autoregression confirms a regime shift in stablecoin dynamics. Overall, human-driven stablecoin flows act as early-warning indicators of political stress, preceding both exchange behavior and algorithmic responses.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00893v1\n    "}}

With the rapid rise of AI-generated code, attribution is playing a critical role in detecting vulnerabilities, flagging malicious content, and ensuring accountability. While AI-vs-human detection usually treats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs leave unique stylistic signatures, even among models belonging to the same family or parameter size. To this end, we introduce LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000 Node.js back-end programs from 20 large language models. Each has four transformed variants, yielding 250,000 unique JavaScript samples and two additional representations (JSIR and AST) for diverse research applications. Using this dataset, we benchmark traditional machine learning classifiers against fine-tuned Transformer encoders and introduce CodeT5-JSA, a custom architecture derived from the 770M-parameter CodeT5 model with its decoder removed and a modified classification head. It achieves 95.8% accuracy on five-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks, surpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We demonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program dataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a result, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and heavy code transformations. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the LLM-NodeJS dataset, Google Colab training scripts, and all related materials on GitHub: https://github.com/LLM-NodeJS-dataset.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10493v2\n    "}}

The current decentralized and proprietary nomenclature creates confusion and significant obstacles for researchers, including difficulties in integrating and correlating disparate CTI reports and TA profiles. This paper introduces HiP (Hesperus is Phosphorus, a reference to the classic question about the Morning and the Evening Star), a methodology for normalizing, integrating, and clustering TA names presumably corresponding to the same entity. Using HiP, we analyze a large dataset collected from 15 sources and spanning 13,371 CTI reports, 17 vendor taxonomies, 3,287 TA names, and 8 mappings between them. Our analysis of the resulting name graph provides insights on key features of the problem, such as the concentration of aliases on a relatively small subset of TAs, the evolution of this phenomenon over the years, and the factors that could explain TA name proliferation. We also report errors in the mappings and methodological pitfalls that contribute to make certain TA name clusters larger than they should be, including the use of temporary names for activity clusters, the existence of common tools and infrastructure, and overlapping operations. We conclude with a discussion on the inherent difficulties to adopt a TA naming standard, a quest fundamentally hampered by the need to share highly-sensitive telemetry that is private to each CTI vendor.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00857v1\n    "}}

However, they introduce operational complexities in service integration and system management that makes swift and accurate anomaly detection and localisation challenging. Despite the complex, dynamic, and interconnected nature of microservice architectures, prior works that investigate metrics for anomaly detection rarely include explicit information about time-varying interdependencies. And whilst prior works on fault localisation typically do incorporate information about dependencies between microservices, they scale poorly to real world large-scale deployments due to their reliance on computationally expensive causal inference. To address these challenges we propose FC-ADL, an end-to-end scalable approach for detecting and localising anomalous changes from microservice metrics based on the neuroscientific concept of functional connectivity. We show that by efficiently characterising time-varying changes in dependencies between microservice metrics we can both detect anomalies and provide root cause candidates without incurring the significant overheads of causal and multivariate approaches. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve top detection and localisation performance across a wide degree of different fault scenarios when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we illustrate the scalability of our approach by applying it to Alibaba's extremely large real-world microservice deployment.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00844v1\n    "}}

Conventional communication schemes often incur significant transmission overhead and latency, while existing trajectory prediction models generally lack environmental perception and logical inference capabilities. This paper presents a trajectory prediction framework that integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI to enhance predictive performance in vehicular environments. In vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a feature-extraction agent at the Roadside Unit (RSU) derives compact representations from historical vehicle trajectories, followed by semantic reasoning performed by a semantic-analysis agent. The RSU then transmits both feature representations and semantic insights to the target vehicle via semantic communication, enabling the vehicle to predict future trajectories by combining received semantics with its own historical data. In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, each vehicle performs local feature extraction and semantic analysis while receiving predicted trajectories from neighboring vehicles, and jointly utilizes this information for its own trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse communication conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00834v1\n    "}}

We devise an end-to-end method for practical LE implementation based on standard cryptographic algorithms, key-bit randomization, simple circuit design techniques, and system-level synthesis operations, all in a correct-by-construction manner.

We provide a complete characterization of all deterministic equilibrium investment strategies. Our results reveal that the solution structure depends critically on the distribution of risk aversion: the equilibrium is unique whenever it exists in the case of finite expected risk aversion, whereas an infinite expectation can lead to infinitely many equilibria or to a unique trivial one (pi equals 0). To address this multiplicity, we introduce three optimality criteria-optimal, uniformly optimal, and uniformly strictly optimal-and explicitly characterize the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding equilibria. Under the same necessary and sufficient condition, the optimal and uniformly optimal equilibria exist uniquely and coincide. Furthermore, by additionally assuming that the market price of risk is non-zero near the terminal time, we show that the optimal (and hence uniformly optimal) equilibrium is also uniformly strictly optimal. Finally, we perform comparative statics to demonstrate that a risk aversion distribution dominating another in the reverse hazard rate order leads to a less aggressive equilibrium strategy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00830v1\n    "}}

Prior work on knowledge poisoning attacks primarily inject false or toxic content, which fact-checking or linguistic analysis easily detects. We reveal a new and subtle threat: bias injection attacks, which insert factually correct yet semantically biased passages into the knowledge base to covertly influence the ideological framing of answers generated by large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that these adversarial passages, though linguistically coherent and truthful, can systematically crowd out opposing views from the retrieved context and steer LLM answers toward the attacker's intended perspective.\n  We precisely characterize this class of attacks and then develop a post-retrieval filtering defense, BiasDef. We construct a comprehensive benchmark based on public question answering datasets to evaluate them. Our results show that: (1) the proposed attack induces significant perspective shifts in LLM answers, effectively evading existing retrieval-based sanitization defenses; and (2) BiasDef outperforms existing methods by reducing adversarial passages retrieved by 15\\% which mitigates perspective shift by 6.2\\times in answers, while enabling the retrieval of 62\\% more benign passages.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00804v1\n    "}}

To address these challenges, we propose AED, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically discover effective and diverse vulnerabilities in autonomous driving policies. We first utilize an LLM to automatically design reward functions for RL training. Then we let the LLM consider a diverse set of accident types and train adversarial policies for different accident types in parallel. Finally, we use preference-based learning to filter ineffective accidents and enhance the effectiveness of each vulnerability. Experiments across multiple simulated traffic scenarios and tested policies show that AED uncovers a broader range of vulnerabilities and achieves higher attack success rates compared with expert-designed rewards, thereby reducing the need for manual reward engineering and improving the diversity and effectiveness of vulnerability discovery.

Although a variety of charging schemes have reported signatures of quantum advantage, the fundamental physical requirements for achieving superextensive charging power remain insufficiently understood. Here, we show that, in addition to Hamiltonian locality, a key structural property, g-extensiveness, quantifying the distribution of interaction energy across lattice sites places a fundamental bound on charging performance in spin-lattice models. We prove that superextensive power scaling is possible only when the interaction-energy distribution becomes increasingly nonuniform, with the maximal local weight growing with system size. This criterion explains why many previously studied protocols fail to exhibit superextensive power, even when the Hamiltonians involve large participation numbers. We further demonstrate that this condition is realized in an experimentally relevant interacting model, where, despite fixed interaction order, the charging power scales superextensively. Our results establish g-extensiveness as a necessary resource for quantum advantage in direct-charging protocols and provide a systematic framework for identifying and engineering physically feasible quantum batteries capable of outperforming classical counterparts in charging power.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00788v1\n    "}}

Unlike existing jailbreak attacks, this weakness is distinct in that it does not involve a specific attack objective, such as generating instructions for \\textit{building a bomb}. Prior attack methods predominantly target localized components of the LLM guardrail. In contrast, involuntary jailbreaks may potentially compromise the entire guardrail structure, which our method reveals to be surprisingly fragile. We merely employ a single universal prompt to achieve this goal. In particular, we instruct LLMs to generate several questions that would typically be rejected, along with their corresponding in-depth responses (rather than a refusal). Remarkably, this simple prompt strategy consistently jailbreaks the majority of leading LLMs, including Claude Opus 4.1, Grok 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT 4.1. We hope this problem can motivate researchers and practitioners to re-evaluate the robustness of LLM guardrails and contribute to stronger safety alignment in future.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13246v2\n    "}}

The rapid pace of development makes it challenging for existing studies to characterize recent evolutionary trends. In addition, intuitive tools to untangle these intricate connections between malware specimens or categories are urgently needed. This paper introduces a manually-reviewed malware source code dataset containing 6032 specimens. Building on and extending current research from a software engineering perspective, we systematically evaluate the scale, development costs, code quality, as well as security and dependencies of modern malware. We further introduce a multi-view genealogy analysis to clarify malware connections: at an overall view, this analysis quantifies the strength and direction of connections among specimens and categories; at a detailed view, it traces the evolutionary histories of individual specimens. Experimental results indicate that, despite persistent shortcomings in code quality, malware specimens exhibit an increasing complexity and standardization, in step with the development of mainstream software engineering practices. Meanwhile, our genealogy analysis intuitively reveals lineage expansion and evolution driven by code reuse, providing new evidence and tools for understanding the formation and evolution of the malware ecosystem.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00741v1\n    "}}

The problem of choosing the right privacy metric in practice leads to a central question: what is a statistically appropriate baseline $f_{\\infty}$ given some prior modeling assumptions? The special case of Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) showed that, under compositions of nearly perfect mechanisms, these trade-off functions exhibit a central limit behavior with a Gaussian limit experiment. Inspired by Le Cam's theory of limits of statistical experiments, we answer this question in full generality in an infinitely divisible setting.\n  We show that suitable composition experiments $(P_n^{\\otimes n}, Q_n^{\\otimes n})$ converge to a binary limit experiment $(P_{\\infty}, Q_{\\infty})$ whose log-likelihood ratio $L = \\log(dQ_{\\infty} / dP_{\\infty})$ is infinitely divisible under $P_{\\infty}$. Thus any limiting trade-off function $f_{\\infty}$ is determined by an infinitely divisible law $P_{\\infty}$, characterized by its Levy--Khintchine triplet, and its Esscher tilt defined by $dQ_{\\infty}(x) = e^{x} dP_{\\infty}(x)$. This characterizes all limiting baseline trade-off functions $f_{\\infty}$ arising from compositions of nearly perfect differentially private mechanisms. Our framework recovers GDP as the purely Gaussian case and yields explicit non-Gaussian limits, including Poisson examples. It also positively resolves the empirical $s^2 = 2k$ phenomenon observed in the GDP paper and provides an optimal mechanism for count statistics achieving asymmetric Poisson differential privacy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00734v1\n    "}}

While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

This creates a structural holdout: sampling neither expands with TP nor balances across PP stages, so its share of iteration time grows as GPUs get faster and it caps pipeline frequency at the last stage. We present SIMPLE, a stage-agnostic, sequence-parallel, overlappable decision plane that disaggregates sampling into a CPU-side service and shrinks its runtime footprint back to a minor, hidden role. SIMPLE combines: (1) sequence-parallel sampling, which shards work along the batch dimension and removes vocabulary-axis collectives; (2) a CPU-based algorithm with column-wise penalties and truncation-first filtering to realize single-pass, linear-time kernels; and (3) speculative hot-vocab sampling (SHVS), which samples on a small hot set with rejection-correctness and uses a simple sizing model to choose the hot-vocab size that maximizes throughput. In evaluation, SIMPLE improves end-to-end throughput by up to 96% and reduces P95 latency by 20-65%. Crucially, SIMPLE requires no user-side code changes and composes with existing data-plane optimizations, unlocking scaling benefits that compound with future GPU generations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00719v1\n    "}}

Existing backdoor attacks against VLMs primarily rely on explicit pixel-level triggers or imperceptible perturbations injected into images. While effective, these approaches reduce stealthiness and remain vulnerable to image-based defenses. We introduce concept-guided backdoor attacks, a new paradigm that operates at the semantic concept level rather than on raw pixels. We propose two different attacks. The first, Concept-Thresholding Poisoning (CTP), uses explicit concepts in natural images as triggers: only samples containing the target concept are poisoned, causing the model to behave normally in all other cases but consistently inject malicious outputs whenever the concept appears. The second, CBL-Guided Unseen Backdoor (CGUB), leverages a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) during training to intervene on internal concept activations, while discarding the CBM branch at inference time to keep the VLM unchanged. This design enables systematic replacement of a targeted label in generated text (for example, replacing \"cat\" with \"dog\"), even when the replacement behavior never appears in the training data. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures and datasets show that both CTP and CGUB achieve high attack success rates while maintaining moderate impact on clean-task performance. These findings highlight concept-level vulnerabilities as a critical new attack surface for VLMs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00713v1\n    "}}

However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains. In addition, the dominance problem of client domains with a large number of samples is identified and, then, addressed with a domain-aware aggregation approach. This work is the first to consider the domain shift in training the semantic communication system for the image reconstruction task. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the model-contrastive FL (MOON) framework by 0.5 for PSNR values under three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, and this gap continues to widen as the channel quality improves.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00711v1\n    "}}

Their runtime-dependent transition probabilities break down the pre-computation strategy that underpins most existing CPU and GPU static random walk optimizations. This leaves practitioners suffering from suboptimal frameworks and having to write hand-tuned kernels that do not adapt to workload diversity. To handle this issue, we present FlexiWalker, the first GPU framework that delivers efficient, workload-generic support for dynamic random walks. Our design-space study shows that rejection sampling and reservoir sampling are more suitable than other sampling techniques under massive parallelism. Thus, we devise (i) new high-performance kernels for them that eliminate global reductions, redundant memory accesses, and random-number generation. Given the necessity of choosing the best-fitting sampling strategy at runtime, we adopt (ii) a lightweight first-order cost model that selects the faster kernel per node at runtime. To enhance usability, we introduce (iii) a compile-time component that automatically specializes user-supplied walk logic into optimized building blocks. On various dynamic random walk workloads with real-world graphs, FlexiWalker outperforms the best published CPU/GPU baselines by geometric means of 73.44x and 5.91x, respectively, while successfully executing workloads that prior systems cannot support. We open-source FlexiWalker in https://github.com/AIS-SNU/FlexiWalker.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00705v1\n    "}}

High expressivity required for robust privacy induces exponentially large dynamical Lie algebras. This structure inevitably leads to barren plateaus. Conversely, trainable models restricted to polynomial-sized algebras remain transparent to algebraic attacks. To resolve this impasse, DyLoC is proposed. This dual-layer architecture employs an orthogonal decoupling strategy. Trainability is anchored to a polynomial-DLA ansatz while privacy is externalized to the input and output interfaces. Specifically, Truncated Chebyshev Graph Encoding (TCGE) is employed to thwart snapshot inversion. Dynamic Local Scrambling (DLS) is utilized to obfuscate gradients. Experiments demonstrate that DyLoC maintains baseline-level convergence with a final loss of 0.186. It outperforms the baseline by increasing the gradient reconstruction error by 13 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, snapshot inversion attacks are blocked when the reconstruction mean squared error exceeds 2.0. These results confirm that DyLoC effectively establishes a verifiable pathway for secure and trainable quantum machine learning.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00699v1\n    "}}

Herein, we uncover an intrinsic scaling law of the magic resource and bond dimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is, the magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic scale with the system size. From a practical perspective, this finding substantially enhances the classical simulability of nonstabilizerness. It also allows us to utilize the bond dimension as a bridge to link the entanglement and the nonlocal magic resource, which extends the capacity perspective that the entanglement plays the role of container for the nonlocal magic resource. Furthermore, the intrinsic scaling enables an information separation between the nonlocal magic resource and the extra entanglement. This, in turn, leads to the conclusion that, any dynamical relation between magic and entanglement resources is ruled out. In other words, it is inappropriate to regard the entanglement as the driving force of the growth and spreading of nonlocal magic resource.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26342v2\n    "}}

In this article, we prove that Zywina's conjecture is true for the family of non-CM elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$ that admit a nontrivial rational cyclic isogeny. This strengthens a result of Lemos that resolved Serre's uniformity question for the same family of curves. Our proof proceeds by analyzing a collection of modular curves associated with each prime isogeny degree, using recent advances on $\\ell$-adic images, isogeny-torsion graphs, and computations of models and rational points.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00652v1\n    "}}

This paper presents the first comparative analysis between blockchain-based and traditional database systems for managing digital twin evidence in forensic investigations. We conducted controlled experiments comparing the Ethereum blockchain with IPFS storage against traditional SQL databases for digital twin evidence management. Our findings reveal that while blockchain provides superior data integrity and immutability, crucial for forensic applications, traditional databases offer better performance consistency. The blockchain implementation showed faster average storage times but higher variability in retrieval operations. Both systems maintained forensic integrity through hash verification, though blockchain's immutable nature provides additional security guarantees essential for legal proceedings.

Most internet-connected embedded devices employ mathematically secure cryptographic algorithms to address security vulnerabilities. Despite such mathematical guarantees, as these algorithms are often implemented in silicon, they leak critical information in terms of power consumption, electromagnetic (EM) radiation, timing, cache hits and misses, photonic emission and so on, leading to side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks. This thesis focuses on low overhead generic circuit-level yet synthesizable countermeasures against power and EM SCA. Existing countermeasures (including proposed) still have relatively high overhead which bars them from being used in energy-constraint IoT devices. We propose a zero-overhead integrated inductive sensor which is able to detect i)EM SCA ii) Clock glitch-based Fault Injection Attack (FIA), and iii) Voltage-glitch based Fault Injection Attack by using a simple ML algorithm. Advent of quantum computer research will open new possibilities for theoretical attacks against existing cryptographic protocols. National Institute of Standard & Technology (NIST) has standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to secure crypto-systems against quantum adversary. I contribute to the standardization procedure by introducing the first silicon-verified Saber (a NIST finalist modulo Learning with Rounding scheme) which consumes lowest energy and area till date amongst all the candidates.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00635v1\n    "}}

A comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then, generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios. Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios, while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10044v2\n    "}}

The proposed solution enhances cluster longevity and communication efficiency through mobility-aware clustering, energy-centric cluster head (CH) selection, and a ground station(GS)-assisted cluster maintenance management mechanism. First, steady multi-hop clusters are constructed, having CHs with not only high stability and high energy but also with steady and high-energy neighboring areas, and then a proper GS-assisted cluster maintenance mechanism is applied. Experimental results, based on extended simulations, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing schemes significantly, in terms of cluster stability, communication overhead, and security resilience.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00623v1\n    "}}

Existing orchestration frameworks optimize single dimensions (Kubernetes prioritizes latency, federated learning preserves privacy, edge computing reduces network distance), creating solutions that struggle under real-world heterogeneity. We present IslandRun, a multi-objective orchestration system that treats computational resources as autonomous \"islands\" spanning personal devices, private edge servers, and public cloud. Our key insights: (1) request-level heterogeneity demands policy-constrained multi-objective optimization, (2) data locality enables routing compute to data rather than data to compute, and (3) typed placeholder sanitization preserves context semantics across trust boundaries. IslandRun introduces agent-based routing, tiered island groups with differential trust, and reversible anonymization. This establishes a new paradigm for privacy-aware, decentralized inference orchestration across heterogeneous personal computing ecosystems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00595v1\n    "}}

Existing methods typically first convert the design into a graph, such as a gate-level netlist or an RTL-derived dataflow graph (DFG), and then use a graph neural network (GNN ) to obtain an embedding of that graph, which (i) loses compact RTL semantics, (ii) relies on shallow GNNs with limited receptive field, and (iii) is largely restricted to coarse, module-level binary HT detection. We propose TrojanLoC, an LLM-based framework for RTL-level HT localization. We use an RTL-finetuned LLM to derive module-level and line-level embeddings directly from RTL code, capturing both global design context and local semantics. Next, we train task-specific classifiers on these embeddings to perform module-level Trojan detection, type prediction, and fine-grained line-level localization. We also introduce TrojanInS, a large synthetic dataset of RTL designs with systematically injected Trojans from four effect-based categories, each accompanied by precise line-level annotations. Our experiments show that TrojanLoC achieves strong module-level performance, reaching 0.99 F1-score for Trojan detection, up to 0.68 higher than baseline, and 0.84 macro-F1 for Trojan-type classification. At the line level, TrojanLoc further achieves up to 0.93 macro-F1, enabling fine-grained localization of Trojan-relevant RTL lines\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00591v1\n    "}}

The framework supports both the DT development lifecycle and the incorporation of simulations during active operation. Through bidirectional data exchange, simulations can update DT models dynamically, while DTs provide real-time feedback to adapt simulation parameters. We describe the architectural design and core software components that ensure flexible interoperability and scalable deployment.

However, these developments also raise significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response, training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference, exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other autoregressive paradigms.

However, traditional protocol logic driven by hard-coded state machines struggles to meet the demands of intelligent and autonomous network architectures. Here, we adopt the agentic AI-based paradigm, driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), characterized by context perception, autonomous reasoning, and tool use. Based on this, we propose Smart-TCP, which re-imagines TCP's core control logic as an autonomous agent. Specifically, the proposed architecture employs a context aggregation mechanism to synthesize the protocol context, utilizes the LLM for autonomous logical reasoning, and invokes an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) as a tool for computation. Furthermore, we establish a dual-agent interaction framework based on this architecture and implement TCP protocol interactions. Experiments demonstrate that the Smart-TCP agent excels in static prediction and error detection, achieving a 93.33% success rate in end-to-end sessions. These results strongly validate the technical feasibility of an agentic AI-based TCP protocol.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00491v1\n    "}}

Prior studies have employed Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as ancillary qumodes to suppress small Gaussian displacement errors, but when the displacement magnitude becomes large, lattice-crossing events arise beyond the correctable range of the GKP state. To address this issue, we concatenate a Gaussian-noise-suppression circuit with an outer analog Steane code that corrects such occasional lattice-crossing events as well as other abrupt displacement errors. Unlike conventional concatenation, which primarily aims to reduce logical error rates, the Steane-GKP duality in encoding provides complementary protection against both large and small displacement errors, enabling CV error correction within the continuous encoding space and contrasting with earlier approaches that concatenate GKP states with repetition codes for discrete qubit or qudit encodings. Analytical results show that, under infinite squeezing, the concatenated code suppresses the variance of Gaussian displacement errors across all qumodes by up to 50 percent while enabling unbiased correction of lattice-crossing events, with a success probability determined by the ratio between the residual Gaussian error standard deviation and the lattice-crossing magnitude. Even with finite squeezing, the proposed architecture continues to provide Gaussian-error suppression together with lattice-crossing correction, and the presence of the outer analog Steane code relaxes the squeezing requirement of the inner GKP states, indicating near-term experimental feasibility. This work establishes a viable route toward fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation and provides new insight into the design of concatenated CV error-correcting architectures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00481v1\n    "}}

Such protocols have found numerous applications in both theoretical studies and real-life scenarios. The existing PIR constructions mainly give multi-server {\\em information-theoretic} PIR (IT-PIR) protocols or single-server computational PIR (CPIR) protocols. Compared with CPIR, IT-PIR protocols are computationally more efficient and secure in the presence of unbounded servers. The most classical and challenging problem in the realm of IT-PIR is constructing protocols with lower {\\em communication complexity}. In this review, we introduce a new discrete structure called {\\em families of orthogonal arrays with span capability} (FOASC) and propose a unified framework for constructing IT-PIR protocols. We show how the most influential IT-PIR protocols in the literature can be captured by the framework. We also put forward several interesting open problems concerning FOASC, whose solutions may result in innovative IT-PIR protocols.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00480v1\n    "}}

Herein, we investigate this arbitrage opportunity by treating the liquidity token as a derivative position in the prices of the underlying assets for the CPMM. In doing so, not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes result, we deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas for these liquidity tokens. Furthermore, with our novel pricing formula, we construct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated (non-market) price which would not permit arbitrage if quoted by the CPMM. We conclude with a discussion of novel AMM designs which would bring the pricing of liquidity tokens into the modern financial era.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11339v3\n    "}}

However, existing correlation methods suffer from two major limitations: limited robustness to noise and partial observations, and poor scalability due to computationally expensive pairwise matching. To address these challenges, we propose RECTor, a machine learning-based framework for traffic correlation under realistic conditions. RECTor employs attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and GRU-based temporal encoding to extract robust flow representations, even when traffic data is incomplete or obfuscated. These embeddings are mapped into a shared space via a Siamese network and efficiently matched using approximate nearest neighbor (aNN) search. Empirical evaluations show that RECTor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCorr, DeepCOFFEA, and FlowTracker, achieving up to 60% higher true positive rates under high-noise conditions and reducing training and inference time by over 50%. Moreover, RECTor demonstrates strong scalability: inference cost grows near-linearly as the number of flows increases. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Tor's anonymity model and highlight the need for advanced model-aware defenses.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00436v1\n    "}}

Stringent data protection regulations limit access to clinical records for training and integrating machine learning models that have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and personalized care outcomes. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, current generative models either struggle with time-series data or lack formal privacy guaranties. In this paper, we enhance a state-of-the-art time-series generative model to better handle longitudinal clinical data while incorporating quantifiable privacy safeguards. Using real data from chronic kidney disease and ICU patients, we evaluate our method through statistical tests, a Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) setup, and expert clinical review. Our non-private model (Augmented TimeGAN) outperforms transformer- and flow-based models on statistical metrics in several datasets, while our private model (DP-TimeGAN) maintains a mean authenticity of 0.778 on the CKD dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models on the privacy-utility frontier. Both models achieve performance comparable to real data in clinician evaluations, providing robust input data necessary for developing models for complex chronic conditions without compromising data privacy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00434v1\n    "}}

Unlike prior approaches, BeaCon leverages dynamic analysis to simulate realistic environments, uncovering container execution paths that may remain hidden during the profiling phase. To address the challenge of exploring vast profiling spaces, we employ efficient heuristics to reveal additional system events with minimal effort. In addition, BeaCon incorporates a security and functionality scoring mechanism to prioritize system calls and capabilities based on their impact on the host OS kernel's security and the functionality of containerized applications. By integrating these scores, BeaCon achieves a customized balance between security and functionality, enabling cloud providers to enforce security measures while maintaining tenant availability. We implemented a prototype of BeaCon using eBPF kernel technology and conducted extensive evaluations. Results from the top 15 containers, which revealed significant improvements, demonstrate that BeaCon identifies an average of 16.5% additional syscalls by applying diverse environments. Furthermore, we evaluated its effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with 45 known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs), showcasing its potential to significantly enhance container security. Additionally, we performed proof-of-concept demonstrations for two well-known security vulnerabilities, showing that BeaCon successfully reduces attack surface by blocking these exploits.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00414v1\n    "}}

However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations. In addition, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research to support future advancements in this important field.

A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00401v1\n    "}}

Heimdall, as a representative GPU-accelerated single-pulse search tool, offers substantial performance advantages over CPU-based approaches. However, its sequential execution model and resource contention in intermediate processing stages limit GPU utilization, leading to suboptimal throughput and increased computational latency. To address these limitations, we present Heimdall++, an optimized successor to Heimdall that incorporates fine-grained GPU parallelization, enhanced memory management, and a multi-threaded framework to decouple CPU-bound and GPU-bound processing stages. This design mitigates the GPU stall problem and improves end-to-end efficiency. We evaluated Heimdall++ on a system equipped with NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPUs using both a single large-scale observational file and multiple files.

Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00382v1\n    "}}

Unlike technology-driven cryptocurrencies, their market dynamics are primarily shaped by viral social media diffusion, celebrity influence, and speculative capital inflows.\n  To capture the distinctive vulnerabilities of these ecosystems, we present the first Memecoin Ecosystem Fragility Framework (ME2F). ME2F formalizes memecoin risks in three dimensions: i) Volatility Dynamics Score capturing persistent and extreme price swings together with spillover from base chains; ii) Whale Dominance Score quantifying ownership concentration among top holders; and iii) Sentiment Amplification Score measuring the impact of attention-driven shocks on market stability.\n  We apply ME2F to representative tokens (over 65\\% market share) and show that fragility is not evenly distributed across the ecosystem. Politically themed tokens such as TRUMP, MELANIA, and LIBRA concentrate the highest risks, combining volatility, ownership concentration, and sensitivity to sentiment shocks. Established memecoins such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE fall into an intermediate range. Benchmark tokens ETH and SOL remain consistently resilient due to deeper liquidity and institutional participation. Our findings provide the first ecosystem-level evidence of memecoin fragility and highlight governance implications for enhancing market resilience in the Web3 era.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00377v1\n    "}}

The Graph Dynamics Analyzer reconstructs application call graphs from service-mesh telemetry and quantifies bidirectional traffic between upstream-downstream microservice pairs. The Networking Dynamics Manager injects and measures realistic cross-node delay and bandwidth patterns via Linux traffic control primitives and distributed agents. The Scheduling Policy Extender offers a pluggable interface and utility library for implementing and evaluating arbitrary scheduling policies, expressed as pod placement and migration strategies.\n  We use iDynamics to implement two representative policies -- a call-graph-aware policy and a hybrid policy that jointly considers traffic and latency -- as case studies demonstrating how the framework can be used to study SLA compliance under dynamic conditions. Experiments on a real cloud-edge cluster, running the DeathStarBench Social Network microservices, show that iDynamics can accurately emulate targeted network conditions, generate diverse call-graph and traffic patterns, and help quantify how different scheduling policies mitigate SLA violations under controllable and repeatable dynamics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16029v4\n    "}}

In many S-shaped utility optimization problems, one should require a liquidation boundary to guarantee the existence of a finite concave envelope function. A first-order SD (FSD) constraint can replace this requirement and provide an alternative for risk management. We explicitly solve the optimal solution under a general S-shaped utility function with a first-order stochastic dominance constraint. However, the second-order SD (SSD) constrained problem under non-concave utilities is difficult to solve analytically due to the invalidity of Sion's maxmin theorem. For this sake, we propose a numerical algorithm to obtain a plausible and sub-optimal solution for general non-concave utilities. The key idea is to detect the poor performance region with respect to the SSD constraints, characterize its structure and modify the distribution on that region to obtain (sub-)optimality. A key financial insight is that the decision maker should follow the SD constraint on the poor performance scenario while conducting the unconstrained optimal strategy otherwise. We provide numerical experiments to show that our algorithm effectively finds a sub-optimal solution in many cases. Finally, we develop an algorithm-guided piecewise-neural-network framework to learn the solution of the SSD problem, which demonstrates accelerated convergence compared to standard neural network approaches.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00299v1\n    "}}

A dual methodology was implemented: evolutionary and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (Genetic Algorithms, Optuna) in Python for numerical data, and distributed processing in Apache Spark for massive textual corpora. The results reveal a \"complexity paradox\": in high-dimensional spaces, optimized linear models (SVM, Logistic Regression) outperformed deep architectures and Gradient Boosting. Conversely, in text-based domains, the constraints of distributed fine-tuning led to overfitting in complex models, whereas robust feature engineering -- specifically Transformer-based embeddings (ROBERTa) and Bayesian Target Encoding -- enabled simpler models to generalize effectively.

However, it introduces privacy risks: an adversary with access to pre- and post-unlearning models can exploit their differences for membership inference or data reconstruction. We show these vulnerabilities arise from two factors: large gradient norms of forget-set samples and the close proximity of unlearned parameters to the original model. To demonstrate their severity, we propose unlearning-specific membership inference and reconstruction attacks, showing that several state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NGP, SCRUB) remain vulnerable. To mitigate this leakage, we introduce WARP, a plug-and-play teleportation defense that leverages neural network symmetries to reduce forget-set gradient energy and increase parameter dispersion while preserving predictions. This reparameterization obfuscates the signal of forgotten data, making it harder for attackers to distinguish forgotten samples from non-members or recover them via reconstruction. Across six unlearning algorithms, our approach achieves consistent privacy gains, reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box and 92% in white-box settings, while maintaining accuracy on retained data. These results highlight teleportation as a general tool for reducing attack success in approximate unlearning.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00272v1\n    "}}

MAPS is evaluated using a synthetic multimodal emergency dataset, achieving user detection accuracies above 70% and SLS generation under 130 seconds in 90% of cases. Results demonstrate that combining audio and visual modalities enhances user detection and show that MAPS provides the perception layer required for autonomous, zero-touch FNs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00259v1\n    "}}

In these cases, a major requirement is getting rid of cables through the adoption of wireless networks. To this purpose, Wi-Fi is currently deemed one of the most promising solutions. Achieving reliable communications over the air for distributed real-time control applications is, however, not devoid of troubles. In fact, bounded transmission latency must be ensured for most of the exchanged packets. Moreover, for devices powered on batteries, energy consumption also needs to be taken into account. In this paper, a joint simulated analysis of these aspects is carried out to quantitatively evaluate what we can practically expect from Wi-Fi technology.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06074v2\n    "}}

Although efficient sequential algorithms exist for this task, the scale of modern networks requires faster, multicore-ready approaches. To this end, we adapt a distributed $k$-core algorithm originally proposed by Montresor et al. to shared-memory systems and implement it in Rust, leveraging the language's strengths in concurrency and memory safety. We developed three progressively optimized versions: SequentialK as a baseline, ParallelK introducing multi-threaded message passing, and FastK further reducing synchronization overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including road networks, web graphs, and social networks, show that FastK consistently outperforms both SequentialK and ParallelK, as well as a reference Python implementation available in the NetworkX library. Results indicate up to an 11x speedup on 16 threads and execution times up to two orders of magnitude faster than the Python implementation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00233v1\n    "}}

However, besides the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally, we discuss open research challenges.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11679v3\n    "}}

However, the extent to which CoT faithfully reflects the underlying reasoning process, and hence the extent to which it can be usefully monitored, may be influenced by certain aspects of training. We investigate how different \\emph{training incentives}, applied to a reasoning model, affect its monitorability. We introduce a novel methodology for measuring monitorability according to whether a monitor can predict a key latent variable using the model's reasoning. When controlling for accuracy, we do not find evidence for consistent effects from commonly used incentives (length penalties and KL regularisation), but we find that adversarial optimisation (penalising monitor accuracy) degrades monitor performance, while direct optimisation for monitorability does not reliably lead to improvements.

In these contexts, the ability to predict changes in wireless channel quality can enable adaptive strategies and significantly improve system robustness. This contribution focuses on the prediction of the Frame Delivery Ratio (FDR), a key metric that represents the percentage of successful transmissions, starting from time sequences of binary outcomes (success/failure) collected in a real scenario. The analysis focuses on two models of deep learning: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), both selected for their ability to predict the outcome of time sequences. Models are compared in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity, with the aim of evaluating their applicability to systems with limited resources. Preliminary results show that both models are able to predict the evolution of the FDR with good accuracy, even from minimal information (a single binary sequence). In particular, CNN shows a significantly lower inference latency, with a marginal loss in accuracy compared to LSTM.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00211v1\n    "}}

We introduce and optimize a semantics-aware metric, Query Version Age of Information (QVAoI), in the system along with other metrics: Query Age of Information (QAoI), Version Age of Information (VAoI), and Age of Information (AoI). By employing the MDP framework, we formulate the optimization problem and determine the optimal transmission policies at the device, which involve deciding the time slots for updating, subject to the energy limitations imposed by the device's battery and energy arrivals. Through analytical and numerical results, we compare the performance of QVAoI-Optimal, QAoI-Optimal, VoI-Optimal, and AoI-Optimal policies with a baseline greedy policy. All semantics-aware policies show significantly improved performance compared to the greedy policy. The QVAoI-Optimal policy, in particular, demonstrates a significant performance improvement by either providing fresher, more relevant, and valuable updates with the same amount of energy arrivals or reducing the number of transmissions in the system to maintain the same level of freshness and significance of information compared to the QAoI-Optimal and other policies.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08587v2\n    "}}

To increase accountability, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) introduced a Remote ID mandate, requiring unmanned aircraft to broadcast their location, operator's location, and identity in real-time. However, current standards leave authentication mechanisms underspecified, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks that can undermine surveillance efforts and potentially disrupt UAS-to-UAS coordination in future deployments. In this paper, we propose TBRD, a practical system for authenticating Remote ID messages in a manner that aligns with existing standards and UAS capabilities. TBRD leverages the TESLA protocol and mobile device TEEs, and introduces a verification mechanism to build a lightweight, mission-scoped authentication system that is both computationally efficient and requires a low communication footprint. We evaluate the performance of TBRD using both an FAA-requirements compatible proof-of-concept implementation for performance metrics and a simulated 4-drone swarm mission scenario to demonstrate its security guarantees under adversarial conditions.

We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to the sensitive reference texts. It interprets sampling from the LLM's next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling without any privacy cost from a small superset of the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent $8\\times$ (or more) reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. InvisibleInk is able to generate, for the first time, high-quality private long-form text at less than $4$-$8\\times$ times the computation cost of non-private generation, paving the way for its practical use. We open-source a pip-installable Python package (invink) for InvisibleInk at https://github.com/cerai-iitm/invisibleink.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02974v2\n    "}}

However, its single-hop architecture results in limited effective range and excessive power consumption for end devices, especially when deployed in large, remote and RF-challenged environments. Existing solutions are either incompatible with LoRaWAN, or limit relaying to a single hop. We present LIMA, a protocol for augmenting an existing or new LoRaWAN deployment with a mesh network of LIMA Routers. LIMA increases the effective coverage range well beyond the maximum LoRa range via multi-hopping, and significantly reduces the energy consumed by end-devices. LIMA requires no changes to the end-device, the servers or the LoRaWAN standard. LIMA builds routes using reverse path forwarding, tunnels LoRaWAN messages over LIMA, provides transparent extension of the existing Adaptive Data Rate (ADR), and suppresses duplicate forwarding if the device is directly reachable from the Gateway. Simulations using Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) show that LIMA increases the delivery rate, scalability, ED energy consumption by up to 5x, 8x and 12.6x respectively, and reduces latency by up to 2.3x. Table-top and outdoor testing with a prototype constructed using a commercial gateway as a starting point confirm that LIMA can be successfully deployed within an existing LoRaWAN system, and can provide range and energy gains transparently.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00161v1\n    "}}

Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit.\n  Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00152v1\n    "}}

Crafting universal filtering rules remains difficult due to their inherent dependence on specific contexts. To address these challenges without relying on threshold calibration or model fine-tuning, this work introduces a semantic consistency analysis between successful and unsuccessful responses, demonstrating that a negation-aware scoring approach captures meaningful patterns. Building on this insight, a novel detection framework called NegBLEURT Forest is proposed to evaluate the degree of alignment between outputs elicited by adversarial prompts and expected safe behaviors. It identifies anomalous responses using the Isolation Forest algorithm, enabling reliable jailbreak detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently achieves top-tier performance, ranking first or second in accuracy across diverse models using the crafted dataset, while competing approaches exhibit notable sensitivity to model and data variations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11784v2\n    "}}

Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23440v1\n    "}}

Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resources. However, typical computations aim to estimate expectation values of local operators and correlation functions to some expected precision. For thermalizing systems at sufficiently high energy densities, such computations do not require storing the full wave function. Nonetheless, constructing classical algorithms for intermediate energy densities has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to accelerate the convergence of Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of expectation values applicable in a broad range of energy densities. We estimate the desired observables by rescaling the MPS results at low bond dimensions with a factor that depends only on the fidelity of the MPS wave function. Using this technique, we simulated the dynamics of the two-dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a $7\\times8$ grid with periodic boundary conditions, using a maximum bond dimension of $\u03c7= 4096$ on a single A100 GPU. We compared our results to similar TFIM simulations on a digital quantum processor.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23438v1\n    "}}

However, existing research has primarily assessed LLMs using publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, leaving their effectiveness on related artificial vulnerabilities largely unexplored. In this study, we empirically evaluate the patching effectiveness and complementarity of several prominent LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT variants, LLaMA, DeepSeek, and Mistral models, using both real and artificial vulnerabilities. Our evaluation employs Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) test execution to concretely assess whether LLM-generated source code successfully patches vulnerabilities. Our results reveal that LLMs patch real vulnerabilities more effectively compared to artificial ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals significant variability across LLMs in terms of overlapping (multiple LLMs patching the same vulnerabilities) and complementarity (vulnerabilities patched exclusively by a single LLM), emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate LLMs for effective vulnerability patching.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23408v1\n    "}}

In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.\n  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.\n  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23406v1\n    "}}

Existing exact unlearning methods typically require frequent retraining from scratch, resulting in high communication cost and long service downtime. To address this, we propose Federated Sequential Group-based Training (FedSGT), an exact unlearning framework for FL. FedSGT partitions the data into uniform groups, and each client may participate in multiple groups. To control communication overhead, each client can limit the number of groups it contributes to. FedSGT then trains multiple sequences of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) modules, each corresponding to a different group permutation. Since the PEFT modules are lightweight and maintained server-side, FedSGT isolates the influence of different data groups into independent modules without incurring significant storage overhead and communication cost. Exact unlearning is thus achieved instantly by deactivating the modules corresponding to the group containing the unlearned data. Furthermore, using multiple training sequences helps maintain high model utility as deletion requests accumulate. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of both the deletion rate -- expected number of deletions before retraining is needed -- and the expected model performance. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate that FedSGT achieves a significantly longer service maintenance under multiple unlearning requests while maintaining comparable learning performance and training efficiency to other exact unlearning baselines. Extensive ablation studies validate the robustness of our method across a wide range of parameter settings.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23393v1\n    "}}

Deterministic communication across heterogeneous 5G-TSN systems requires joint scheduling between both domains. A key prerequisite for time-aware end-to-end scheduling is determining the forwarding delay for each TSN Traffic Class at every bridge, referred to as Bridge Delay (BD). Hence, to integrate 5G as a transparent TSN bridge, the 5G BD must be determined and guaranteed. Unlike wired bridges, the 5G BD relies on wireless resource management characteristics, such as the Time Division Duplex pattern and radio resource allocation procedure. In particular, traditional Uplink (UL) schedulers are optimized for throughput but often fail to meet the deadline requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a heterogeneous radio resource scheduler that integrates static and dynamic scheduling. The algorithm pre-allocates resources for time-sensitive periodic streams based on the reported BDs, ensuring alignment with the TSN mechanisms Time-Aware Shaper and Per-Stream Filtering and Policing. Meanwhile, remaining resources are dynamically allocated to non-deterministic flows using established strategies such as Proportional Fair, Max C/I, or a Quality of Service-aware priority-based scheduler. The scheduler's performance is evaluated through OMNeT++ simulations. The results demonstrate support for diverse TSN flows while ensuring deadline-aware scheduling of time-sensitive UL traffic in mobility scenarios. Periodic time-sensitive flows are end-to-end scheduled across domains, improving the resource efficiency by 28% compared to the Configured Grant baseline. While reliability is preserved, non-deterministic rate-sensitive flows benefit from the improved resource utilization, resulting in higher throughput\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23373v1\n    "}}

This paper investigates multi-armed bandit (MAB) strategies as a data-driven approach for decentralized, online channel access optimization in Wi-Fi, targeting dynamic channel access settings: primary channel, channel width, and contention window (CW) adjustment. Key design aspects are examined, including the adoption of joint versus factorial action spaces, the inclusion of contextual information, and the nature of the action-selection strategy (optimism-driven, unimodal, or randomized). State-of-the-art algorithms and a proposed lightweight contextual approach, E-RLB, are evaluated through simulations. Results show that contextual and optimism-driven strategies consistently achieve the highest performance and fastest adaptation under recurrent conditions. Unimodal structures require careful graph construction to ensure that the unimodality assumption holds. Randomized exploration, adopted in the proposed E-RLB, can induce disruptive parameter reallocations, especially in multi-player settings. Decomposing the action space across several specialized agents accelerates convergence but increases sensitivity to randomized exploration and demands coordination under shared rewards to avoid correlated learning. Finally, despite its inherent inefficiencies from epsilon-greedy exploration, E-RLB demonstrates effective adaptation and learning, highlighting its potential as a viable low-complexity solution for realistic dynamic deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23352v1\n    "}}

Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sel showed that no non-constant function $f(x,y)$ can be computed correctly by two parties using content-oblivious communication over a single edge, where one party holds $x$ and the other holds $y$. This seemingly ruled out many natural graph problems on non-2-edge-connected graphs.\n  In this work, we show that, with the knowledge of network topology $G$, leader election is possible in a wide range of graphs.\n  Impossibility: Graphs symmetric about an edge admit no randomized terminating leader election algorithm, even when nodes have unique identifiers and full knowledge of $G$.\n  Leader election algorithms: Trees that are not symmetric about any edge admit a quiescently terminating leader election algorithm with topology knowledge, even in anonymous networks, using $O(n^2)$ messages, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Moreover, even-diameter trees admit a terminating leader election given only the knowledge of the network diameter $D = 2r$, with message complexity $O(nr)$.\n  Necessity of topology knowledge: In the family of graphs $\\mathcal{G} = \\{P_3, P_5\\}$, both the 3-path $P_3$ and the 5-path $P_5$ admit a quiescently terminating leader election if nodes know the topology exactly. However, if nodes only know that the underlying topology belongs to $\\mathcal{G}$, then terminating leader election is impossible.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23297v1\n    "}}

However, limited and heterogeneous local datasets, as well as resource-constrained deployment, severely degrade both model generalization and resource utilization, leading to a compromised learning performance. Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges. First, we derive an information-theoretic generalization statement that characterizes the discrepancy between training and testing function losses and embed it into the convergence analysis. It reveals that a larger local generalization statement can undermine the global convergence. Then, we formulate a generalization-aware average squared gradient norm bound minimization problem, by jointly optimizing the pruning ratios, client selection, and communication-computation resources under energy and delay constraints. Despite its non-convexity, the resulting mixed-integer problem is efficiently solved via an alternating optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior learning performance than state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization for efficient FEEL.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23282v1\n    "}}

However, the structural design of these varied services, along with their reliance on auto-scalers for dynamic internet traffic, introduces significant coordination challenges. As we demonstrate in this paper, common default retry patterns used between misaligned services can turn into retry storms which drive up resource usage and costs, leading to self-inflicted Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) scenarios. To overcome these problems we introduce RetryGuard, a distributed framework for productive control of retry patterns across interdependent microservices. By managing retry policy on a per-service basis and making parallel decisions, RetryGuard prevents retry storms, curbs resource contention, and mitigates escalating operational costs. RetryGuard makes its decisions based on an analytic model that captures the relationships among retries, throughput (rejections), delays, and costs. Experimental results show that RetryGuard significantly reduces resource usage and costs compared to AWS standard and advanced retry policies. We further demonstrate its scalability and superior performance in a more complex Kubernetes deployment with the Istio service mesh, where it achieves substantial improvements.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23278v1\n    "}}

Yet, often Markovian approximations to quantum dynamics are studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate the limitations of the Markovian approximation within two paradigmatic models describing a single damped harmonic oscillator. These models are governed by distinct quantum Langevin equations, although both are constructed to satisfy the same set of phenomenological criteria: the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum, the Kubo response relation, the virial theorem, and the equilibrium quantum variance. The limitations of the Markovian approximation are underscored by the classical limit, violations of the Ehrenfest theorem, the breakdown of complete and simple positivity in the reconstructed master equations, and anomalies in thermalisation behaviour. Further phenomenological differences between the two models are illustrated through their quantum relaxation dynamics and phase diagrams, derived from their reinterpretation as mean-field approximations of a many-body interacting magnet. Our analysis explicitly reveals intrinsic inconsistencies introduced by the Markovian approximation, emphasising the need for non-Markovian frameworks for a consistent description of open quantum dynamics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06312v2\n    "}}

This challenge is magnified in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where devices face stringent bandwidth, latency, and energy constraints. Conventional secure aggregation protocols, while essential for protecting model updates, frequently require multiple interaction rounds, large payload sizes, and per-client costs rendering them impractical for many edge deployments.\n  In this work, we present Hyb-Agg, a lightweight and communication-efficient secure aggregation protocol that integrates Multi-Key CKKS (MK-CKKS) homomorphic encryption with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)-based additive masking. Hyb-Agg reduces the secure aggregation process to a single, non-interactive client-to-server transmission per round, ensuring that per-client communication remains constant regardless of the number of participants. This design eliminates partial decryption exchanges, preserves strong privacy under the RLWE, CDH, and random oracle assumptions, and maintains robustness against collusion by the server and up to $N-2$ clients.\n  We implement and evaluate Hyb-Agg on both high-performance and resource-constrained devices, including a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating that it delivers sub-second execution times while achieving a constant communication expansion factor of approximately 12x over plaintext size. By directly addressing the communication bottleneck, Hyb-Agg enables scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning that is practical for real-world IoT deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23252v1\n    "}}

We rigorously quantify the privacy-utility trade-off and demonstrate (via LOSO validation) that our Privacy-Aware (PA) model achieves performance statistically indistinguishable from a non-private model, proving that utility does not require sacrificing privacy.

Malware experts seek to categorize and classify incoming samples to confirm their trustworthiness or prove their maliciousness. One of the ways in which groups of malware samples can be identified is through malware clustering. Despite the efforts of the community, malware clustering which incorporates benign samples has been under-explored. Moreover, despite the availability of larger public benchmark malware datasets, malware clustering studies have avoided fully utilizing these datasets in their experiments, often resorting to small datasets with only a few families. Additionally, the current state-of-the-art solutions for malware clustering remain unclear. In our study, we evaluate malware clustering quality and establish the state-of-the-art on Bodmas and Ember - two large public benchmark malware datasets. Ours is the first study of malware clustering performed on whole malware benchmark datasets. Additionally, we extend the malware clustering task by incorporating benign samples. Our results indicate that incorporating benign samples does not significantly degrade clustering quality. We find that there are significant differences in the quality of the created clusters between Ember and Bodmas, as well as a private industry dataset. Contrary to popular opinion, our top clustering performers are K-Means and BIRCH, with DBSCAN and HAC falling behind.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23198v1\n    "}}

As the standard paradigm for IP ownership verification, LLM fingerprinting thus plays a vital role in addressing this challenge. Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08905v2\n    "}}

The simulation of thermal equilibrium in imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics. For reference, we use the Drude model as the long-wavelength limit of the Lindhard response, presenting its analytical continuation into the imaginary time and Matsubara series. We demonstrate great agreement within $1\\%$ between PIMC and the reference model, indicating negligible numerical biases and physical many-body effects in metallic densities.

Furthermore, it is a great challenge how to improve the training efficiency while ensuring the detection accuracy in the highly heterogeneous and resource-constrained IoT networks. Meanwhile, the communication cost between clients and the server is also a problem that can not be ignored. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Federated Semi-Supervised and Semi-Asynchronous (FedS3A) learning for anomaly detection in IoT networks. First, we consider a more realistic assumption that labeled data is only available at the server, and pseudo-labeling is utilized to implement federated semi-supervised learning, in which a dynamic weight of supervised learning is exploited to balance the supervised learning at the server and unsupervised learning at clients. Then, we propose a semi-asynchronous model update and staleness tolerant distribution scheme to achieve a trade-off between the round efficiency and detection accuracy. Meanwhile, the staleness of local models and the participation frequency of clients are considered to adjust their contributions to the global model. In addition, a group-based aggregation function is proposed to deal with the non-IID distribution of the data. Finally, the difference transmission based on the sparse matrix is adopted to reduce the communication cost. Extensive experimental results show that FedS3A can achieve greater than 98% accuracy even when the data is non-IID and is superior to the classic FL-based algorithms in terms of both detection performance and round efficiency, achieving a win-win situation. Meanwhile, FedS3A successfully reduces the communication cost by higher than 50%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11981v3\n    "}}

Proactive detection of cyber threats has become essential to help security teams identify potential risks and implement effective mitigation measures. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) plays a key role by providing security analysts with evidence-based knowledge about cyber threats. CTI information can be extracted using various techniques and data sources; however, machine learning has proven promising. As for data sources, social networks and online discussion forums are commonly explored. In this study, we apply text mining techniques and machine learning to data collected from Dark Web forums in Brazilian Portuguese to identify malicious posts. Our contributions include the creation of three original datasets, a novel multi-stage labeling process combining indicators of compromise (IoCs), contextual keywords, and manual analysis, and a comprehensive evaluation of text representations and classifiers. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus specifically on Brazilian Portuguese content in this domain. The best-performing model, using LightGBM and TF-IDF, was able to detect relevant posts with high accuracy. We also applied topic modeling to validate the model's outputs on unlabeled data, confirming its robustness in real-world scenarios.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23183v1\n    "}}

We present LockForge, a first-of-its-kind, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework that turns LL descriptions in papers into executable and tested code. LockForge provides a carefully crafted pipeline realizing forethought, implementation, iterative refinement, and a multi-stage validation, all to systematically bridge the gap between prose and practice for complex LL schemes. For validation, we devise (i) an LLM-as-Judge stage with a scoring system considering behavioral checks, conceptual mechanisms, structural elements, and reproducibility on benchmarks, and (ii) an independent LLM-as-Examiner stage for ground-truth assessment. We apply LockForge to 10 seminal LL schemes, many of which lack reference implementations. Our evaluation on multiple SOTA LLMs, including ablation studies, reveals the significant complexity of the task. We show that an advanced reasoning model and a sophisticated, multi-stage framework like LockForge are required. We release all implementations and benchmarks, providing a reproducible and fair foundation for evaluation of further LL research.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18531v2\n    "}}

Today, the number of GPTs has reached three millions, with the range of specific expert domains becoming increasingly diverse. However, given the consistent framework shared among these LLM agent applications, systemic security vulnerabilities may exist and remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we present an empirical study on the security vulnerabilities of GPTs. Building upon prior research on LLM security, we first adopt a platform-user perspective to conduct a comprehensive attack surface analysis across different system components. Then, we design a systematic and multidimensional attack suite with the explicit objectives of information leakage and tool misuse based on the attack surface analysis, thereby concretely demonstrating the security vulnerabilities that various components of GPT-based systems face. Finally, we accordingly propose defense mechanisms to address the aforementioned security vulnerabilities. By increasing the awareness of these vulnerabilities and offering critical insights into their implications, this study seeks to facilitate the secure and responsible application of GPTs while contributing to developing robust defense mechanisms that protect users and systems against malicious attacks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00136v1\n    "}}

However, its computation and communication processes remain sequential, resulting in limited system efficiency. To overcome this limitation, this paper applies pipeline parallelism (PP) of distributed training to SL in wireless networks, proposing the so-called communication-computation pipeline parallel split learning (C$^2$P$^2$SL). By considering the communicating and computing processes of UEs and BS as an overall pipeline, C$^2$P$^2$SL achieves pipeline parallelization among different micro-batches which are split from each batch of data samples. The overlap of communication and computation in this way significantly reduces the total training time. Given that training efficiency is affected by position of cutting layer and heterogeneity of the UEs, we formulate a joint optimization problem of task split and resource allocation, and design a solution based on alternating optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that C$^2$P$^2$SL significantly reduces system training time by over 38\\% while maintaining convergence accuracy under different communication conditions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23167v1\n    "}}

However, their knowledge is limited to a fixed cutoff date, making them prone to generating code vulnerable to newly disclosed CVEs. Frequent fine-tuning with new CVE sets is costly, and existing LLM-based approaches focus on oversimplified CWE examples and require providing explicit bug locations to LLMs, limiting their ability to patch complex real-world vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we propose AutoPatch, a multi-agent framework designed to patch vulnerable LLM-generated code, particularly those introduced after the LLMs' knowledge cutoff. AutoPatch integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a structured database of recently disclosed vulnerabilities, comprising 525 code snippets derived from 75 high-severity CVEs across real-world systems such as the Linux kernel and Chrome. AutoPatch combines semantic and taint analysis to identify the most relevant CVE and leverages enhanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to construct enriched prompts for verification and patching. Our unified similarity model, which selects the most relevant vulnerabilities, achieves 90.4 percent accuracy in CVE matching. AutoPatch attains 89.5 percent F1-score for vulnerability verification and 95.0 percent accuracy in patching, while being over 50x more cost-efficient than traditional fine-tuning approaches.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04195v2\n    "}}

We demonstrate that a two-dimensional array of three-level atoms operating under electromagnetically induced transparency can function as a tunable dual-band atomic mirror, where two independently controllable reflection bands emerge from the collective optical responses mediated by dipole-dipole interactions. These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure. This scheme provides a fully tunable dual-band atomic mirror operating across broad frequency and angular ranges, offering a practical and experimentally accessible pathway toward reconfigurable photonic elements in atomic-array platforms at low energy levels.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23032v1\n    "}}

For this reason, security-oriented disciplines of signal processing have received increasing attention in the last decades: multimedia forensics, digital watermarking, biometrics, network monitoring, steganography and steganalysis are just a few examples. Even though each of these fields has its own peculiarities, they all have to deal with a common problem: the presence of one or more adversaries aiming at making the system fail. Adversarial Signal Processing lays the basis of a general theory that takes into account the impact that the presence of an adversary has on the design of effective signal processing tools. By focusing on the application side of Adversarial Signal Processing, namely adversarial information fusion in distributed sensor networks, and adopting a game-theoretic approach, this thesis contributes to the above mission by addressing four issues. First, we address decision fusion in distributed sensor networks by developing a novel soft isolation defense scheme that protect the network from adversaries, specifically, Byzantines. Second, we develop an optimum decision fusion strategy in the presence of Byzantines. In the next step, we propose a technique to reduce the complexity of the optimum fusion by relying on a novel near-optimum message passing algorithm based on factor graphs. Finally, we introduce a defense mechanism to protect decentralized networks running consensus algorithm against data falsification attacks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23026v1\n    "}}

By allowing multiple proposers per slot and organizing blocks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), Areon achieves robustness under partial synchrony. Blocks reference each other within a sliding window, forming maximal antichains that represent parallel ``votes'' on history. Conflicting subDAGs are resolved by a closest common ancestor (CCA)-local, window-filtered fork choice that compares the weight of each subDAG -- the number of recent short references -- and prefers the heavier one. Combined with a structural invariant we call Tip-Boundedness (TB), this yields a bounded-width frontier and allows honest work to aggregate quickly.\n  We formalize an idealized protocol (Areon-Ideal) that abstracts away network delay and reference bounds, and a practical protocol (Areon-Base) that adds VRF-based eligibility, bounded short and long references, and application-level validity and conflict checks at the block level. On top of DAG analogues of the classical common-prefix, chain-growth, and chain-quality properties, we prove a backbone-style $(k,\\varepsilon)$-finality theorem that calibrates confirmation depth as a function of the window length and target tail probability. We focus on consensus at the level of blocks; extending the framework to richer transaction selection, sampling, and redundancy policies is left to future work.\n  Finally, we build a discrete-event simulator and compare Areon-Base against a chain-based baseline (Ouroboros Praos) under matched block-arrival rates. Across a wide range of adversarial stakes and network delays, Areon-Base achieves bounded-latency finality with consistently lower reorganization frequency and depth.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23025v1\n    "}}

By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation.

Quantum Cryptography from a Geometric Perspective\n    summary: Can a secret be hidden not in which quantum state is prepared, but in the way that state \\emph{moves} through its space of possibilities? Motivated by this question, we propose an essential geometric perspective on quantum cryptography in which projective Hilbert space and its entanglement foliations play a central role. The basic ingredients are: (a) the Fubini-Study metric on the manifold of pure states, (b) a family of entanglement measures viewed as scalar functions on this manifold, and (c) controlled trajectories generated by unitary operations.\n  The geometric structure -- state manifold, metric, and allowed moves -- is fully public, as is the functional form of the entanglement family. What remains secret is the choice of parameter $\u03b8$ that selects a specific entanglement functional $E_\u03b8$ and the corresponding foliation into constant-entanglement hypersurfaces. In this setting, classical messages are encoded not only in the sequence of states but also in the pattern of upward, downward, or tangential steps with respect to the hidden foliation. We formalize this idea in terms of geometric entanglement codes and illustrate it with two toy constructions in which incompatible foliations play the role of mutually unbiased bases.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22984v1\n    "}}

The three-dominated disordered region has tri-partite entanglement causing a vanishingly small concurrence, while it acquires maximum value around the critical points. Considering the above model as an environment, we construct a generalized central spin model where two central spins, initially in an unentangled pure state, are coupled locally to two distinct sites of the environmental spin chain. We study the generation of mixed state entanglement between the central spins when the transverse field of the environment is kept fixed, and suddenly quenched, referring to equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of the central spins, respectively. For the critical environment in the equilibrium, the concurrence shows a dip-revival structure governed by quasi-particle movement. In the non-equilibrium study, we find an initial growth of concurrence followed by a two-stage fall for the inter-phase quench which is governed by dynamic decoherence channels. The central spins are maximally entangled for a quench in the vicinity of a multicritical point, which arises due to three-spin interaction only. The concurrence becomes long-lived for an intra-phase quench, and this sustainability depends on the strength of the three-spin interaction. Therefore, the three-spin interaction indeed helps in generating bi-partite entanglement in the central spins.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22966v1\n    "}}

Existing defenses either depend on single trusted auditors, creating single points of failure, or sacrifice efficiency for robustness. To resolve this tension, we propose \\textbf{AgentShield}, a distributed framework for efficient, decentralized auditing. AgentShield introduces a novel three-layer defense: \\textbf{(i) Critical Node Auditing} prioritizes high-influence agents via topological analysis; \\textbf{(ii) Light Token Auditing} implements a cascade protocol using lightweight sentry models for rapid discriminative verification; and \\textbf{(iii) Two-Round Consensus Auditing} triggers heavyweight arbiters only upon uncertainty to ensure global agreement. This principled design optimizes the robustness-efficiency trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that AgentShield achieves a 92.5\\% recovery rate and reduces auditing overhead by over 70\\% compared to existing methods, maintaining high collaborative accuracy across diverse MAS topologies and adversarial scenarios.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22924v1\n    "}}

However, existing methods often face significant limitations: many require clients to perform computationally expensive proximal operations, and their performance is frequently vulnerable to data heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel composite federated learning algorithm called \\textbf{FedCanon}, designed to solve the optimization problems comprising a possibly non-convex loss function and a weakly convex, potentially non-smooth regularization term. By decoupling proximal mappings from local updates, FedCanon requires only a single proximal evaluation on the server per iteration, thereby reducing the overall proximal computation cost. Concurrently, it integrates control variables into local updates to mitigate the client drift arising from data heterogeneity. The entire architecture avoids the complex subproblems of primal-dual alternatives. The theoretical analysis provides the first rigorous convergence guarantees for this proximal-skipping framework in the general non-convex setting. It establishes that FedCanon achieves a sublinear convergence rate, and a linear rate under the Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz condition, without the restrictive bounded heterogeneity assumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedCanon outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly under heterogeneous data distributions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11903v2\n    "}}

The effectiveness of these evaluations faces a significant challenge: strategic underperformance, or ``sandbagging'', where models deliberately underperform during evaluation. Sandbagging can manifest either through explicit developer intervention or through unintended model behavior, presenting a fundamental obstacle to accurate capability assessment. We introduce a novel sandbagging detection method based on injecting noise of varying magnitudes into model weights. While non-sandbagging models show predictable performance degradation with increasing noise, we demonstrate that sandbagging models exhibit anomalous performance improvements, likely due to disruption of underperformance mechanisms while core capabilities remain partially intact. Through experiments across various model architectures, sizes, and sandbagging techniques, we establish this distinctive response pattern as a reliable, model-agnostic signal for detecting sandbagging behavior. Importantly, we find noise-injection is capable of eliciting the full performance of Mistral Large 120B in a setting where the model underperforms without being instructed to do so. Our findings provide a practical tool for AI evaluation and oversight, addressing a challenge in ensuring accurate capability assessment of frontier AI systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01784v2\n    "}}

In production, LoRA-based models are served at scale, creating multi-tenant environments with hundreds of adapters sharing a base model. However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized. We present LoRAServe, a workload-aware dynamic adapter placement and routing framework designed to tame rank diversity in LoRA serving. By dynamically rebalancing adapters across GPUs and leveraging GPU Direct RDMA for remote access, LoRAServe maximizes throughput and minimizes tail latency under real-world workload drift. Evaluations on production traces from Company X show that LoRAServe elicits up to 2$\\times$ higher throughput, up to 9$\\times$ lower TTFT, while using up to 50% fewer GPUs under SLO constraints compared to state-of-the-art systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22880v1\n    "}}

By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22542v3\n    "}}

However, the integration of multiple modalities introduces heterogeneity in both the model and training data, creating unique systems challenges.\n  We propose DistTrain, a disaggregated training system for multimodal LLMs. DistTrain incorporates two novel disaggregation techniques to address model and data heterogeneity, respectively. The first is disaggregated model orchestration, which separates the training for modality encoder, LLM backbone, and modality generator. This allows the three components to adaptively and independently orchestrate their resources and parallelism configurations. The second is disaggregated data preprocessing, which decouples data preprocessing from training. This eliminates resource contention between preprocessing and training, and enables efficient data reordering to mitigate stragglers within and between microbatches caused by data heterogeneity. We evaluate DistTrain across different sizes of multimodal LLMs on a large-scale production cluster. The experimental results show that DistTrain achieves 54.7% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) when training a 72B multimodal LLM on 1172 GPUs and outperforms Megatron-LM by up to 2.2x on training throughput.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04275v4\n    "}}

However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20982v2\n    "}}

A key limitation of existing TokCom designs lies in the assumption of uniform token importance, which leads to the adoption of equal error protection (EEP). However, compressed one-dimensional (1D) token sequences inherently exhibit heterogeneous semantic importance hierarchies, rendering EEP schemes suboptimal. To address this, this paper proposes TokCom-UEP, a novel semantic importance-matched unequal error protection (UEP) framework designed for resilient image transmission. TokCom-UEP integrates rateless UEP coding with the non-uniform semantic importance of tokens by partitioning source tokens into nested expanding windows, assigning higher selection probabilities to windows containing critical tokens to ensure their prioritized recovery. Simulation results demonstrate that TokCom-UEP outperforms EEP schemes in terms of three core semantic restoration metrics and spectral efficiency under low-overhead conditions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22859v1\n    "}}

Since 2022, research in this area has rapidly expanded, giving rise to diverse technical paradigms and early applications. To address the growing need for consolidation, this paper presents the first comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth survey of quantum Transformer models. First, we delineate the research scope, focusing on improving Transformer parts with quantum methods, and introduce foundational concepts in classical Transformers and quantum machine learning. Then we organize existing studies into two main paradigms: PQC-based and QLA-based, with PQC-based paradigm further divided into QKV-only Quantum Mapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Holistic Attention. and Quantum-Assisted Optimization, analyzing their core mechanisms and architectural traits. We also summarize empirical results that demonstrate preliminary quantum advantages, especially on small-scale tasks or resource-constrained settings. Following this, we examine key technical challenges, such as complexity-resource trade-offs, scalability and generalization limitations, and trainability issues including barren plateaus, and provide potential solutions, including quantumizing classical transformer variants with lower complexity, hybrid designs, and improved optimization strategies. Finally, we propose several promising future directions, e.g., scaling quantum modules into large architectures, applying quantum Transformers to domains with inherently quantum data (e.g., physics, chemistry), and developing theory-driven designs grounded in quantum information science. This survey will help researchers and practitioners quickly grasp the overall landscape of current quantum Transformer research and promote future developments in this emerging field.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03192v5\n    "}}

This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.\n  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \\leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.\n  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \\mod 2)$ for all $n \\geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22856v1\n    "}}

Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13635v3\n    "}}

Particularly, the tight coupling between clients and the server in existing SL frameworks results in frequent bidirectional data flows and iterative training across all clients, violating the \"Isolated\" principle and making them struggle to implement SISA for independent and efficient unlearning. To address this, we propose SplitWiper with a new one-way-one-off propagation scheme, which leverages the inherently \"Sharded\" structure of SL and decouples neural signal propagation between clients and the server, enabling effective SISA unlearning even in scenarios with absent clients. We further design SplitWiper+ to enhance client label privacy, which integrates differential privacy and label expansion strategy to defend the privacy of client labels against the server and other potential adversaries. Experiments across diverse data distributions and tasks demonstrate that SplitWiper achieves 0% accuracy for unlearned labels, and 8% better accuracy for retained labels than non-SISA unlearning in SL. Moreover, the one-way-one-off propagation maintains constant overhead, reducing computational and communication costs by 99%. SplitWiper+ preserves 90% of label privacy when sharing masked labels with the server.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10422v8\n    "}}

The 'polynomial integer index multiplication' method is a set of algorithms implemented in python code. We demonstrate the method to be faster than both the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) and Karatsuba for multiplication within a certain bit range. Also implemented in python code for comparison purposes with the polynomial radix 2 integer method. We demonstrate that it is possible to express any integer or real number as a list of integer indices, representing a finite series in base two. The finite series of integer index representation of a number can then be stored and distributed across multiple CPUs / GPUs. We show that operations of addition and multiplication can be applied as two's complement additions operating on the index integer representations and can be fully distributed across a given CPU / GPU architecture. We demonstrate fully distributed arithmetic operations such that the 'polynomial integer index multiplication' method overcomes the current limitation of parallel multiplication methods.

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a vital role in identifying potential security attacks to ensure the secure operation of UAV swarm networks. However, conventional IDS primarily focuses on binary classification with resource-intensive neural networks and faces challenges, including latency, privacy breaches, increased performance overhead, and model drift. This research aims to address these challenges by developing a novel lightweight and federated continuous learning-based IDS scheme. Our proposed model facilitates decentralized training across diverse UAV swarms to ensure data heterogeneity and privacy. The performance evaluation of our model demonstrates significant improvements, with classification accuracies of 99.45% on UKM-IDS, 99.99% on UAV-IDS, 96.85% on TLM-UAV dataset, and 98.05% on Cyber-Physical datasets.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22791v1\n    "}}

Cloud-edge inference has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving privacy in LLM services by retaining sensitive computations on local devices. However, existing cloud-edge inference approaches apply uniform privacy protection without considering input sensitivity, resulting in unnecessary perturbation and degraded utility even for non-sensitive tokens. To address this limitation, we propose Privacy-aware Routing for Inference with Semantic Modulation (PRISM), a context-aware framework that dynamically balances privacy and inference quality. PRISM executes in four stages: (1) the edge device profiles entity-level sensitivity; (2) a soft gating module on the edge selects an execution mode - cloud, edge, or collaboration; (3) for collaborative paths, the edge applies adaptive two-layer local differential privacy based on entity risks; and (4) the cloud LLM generates a semantic sketch from the perturbed prompt, which is then refined by the edge-side small language model (SLM) using local context. Our results show that PRISM consistently achieves superior privacy-utility trade-offs across various scenarios, reducing energy consumption and latency to 40-50% of baseline methods such as Uniform and Selective LDP, while maintaining high output quality under strong privacy constraints. These findings are validated through comprehensive evaluations involving realistic prompts, actual energy measurements, and heterogeneous cloud-edge model deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22788v1\n    "}}

The study employs ARDL technique and documents several findings. First, cryptomarket-related factors such as market beta, trading volume, and volatility appear to be significant determinant for all five cryptocurrencies both in short- and long-run. Second, attractiveness of cryptocurrencies also matters in terms of their price determination, but only in long-run. This indicates that formation (recognition) of the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies are subjected to time factor. In other words, it travels slowly within the market. Third, SP500 index seems to have weak positive long-run impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litcoin, while its sign turns to negative losing significance in short-run, except Bitcoin that generates an estimate of -0.20 at 10% significance level. Lastly, error-correction models for Bitcoin, Etherem, Dash, Litcoin, and Monero show that cointegrated series cannot drift too far apart, and converge to a long-run equilibrium at a speed of 23.68%, 12.76%, 10.20%, 22.91%, and 14.27% respectively.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22782v1\n    "}}

Mesh-based MC (MMC) offers enhanced precision for complex tissue structures using tetrahedral mesh models. Despite significant speedups achieved on graphics processing units (GPUs), MMC performance remains hindered by the computational cost of frequent ray-boundary intersection tests.\n  Aim: We propose a highly accelerated MMC algorithm, RT-MMC, that leverages the hardware-accelerated ray traversal and intersection capabilities of ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) on modern GPUs.\n  Approach: Implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX platform, RT-MMC extends graphics ray-tracing pipelines towards volumetric ray-tracing in turbid media, eliminating the need for challenging tetrahedral mesh generation while delivering significant speed improvements through hardware acceleration. It also intrinsically supports wide-field sources without complex mesh retesselation.\n  Results: RT-MMC demonstrates excellent agreement with traditional software-ray-tracing MMC algorithms while achieving 1.5x to 4.5x speedups across multiple GPU architectures. These performance gains significantly enhance the practicality of MMC for routine simulations.\n  Conclusion: Migration from software- to hardware-based ray-tracing not only greatly simplifies MMC simulation workflows, but also results in significant speedups that are expected to increase further as ray-tracing hardware rapidly gains adoption. Adoption of graphics ray-tracing pipelines in quantitative MMC simulations enables leveraging of emerging hardware resources and benefits a wide range of biophotonics applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22779v1\n    "}}

However, they remain highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing guardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, ShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents, we introduce ShieldAgent-Bench, a dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web environments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that ShieldAgent achieves SOTA on ShieldAgent-Bench and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 11.3% on average with a high recall of 90.1%. Additionally, ShieldAgent reduces API queries by 64.7% and inference time by 58.2%, demonstrating its high precision and efficiency in safeguarding agents.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22738v2\n    "}}

However, this reliance on motifs makes GNNs vulnerable to adversarial netlist rewrites; even small-scale edits can mislead GNN predictions. Existing adversarial approaches, ranging from synthesis-recipe perturbations to gate transformations, come with high design overheads. We present NetDeTox, an automated end-to-end framework that orchestrates large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) in a systematic manner, enabling focused local rewriting. The RL agent identifies netlist components critical for GNN-based reasoning, while the LLM devises rewriting plans to diversify motifs that preserve functionality. Iterative feedback between the RL and LLM stages refines adversarial rewritings to limit overheads. Compared to the SOTA work AttackGNN, NetDeTox successfully degrades the effectiveness of all security schemes with fewer rewrites and substantially lower area overheads (reductions of 54.50% for GNN-RE, 25.44% for GNN4IP, and 41.04% for OMLA, respectively). For GNN4IP, ours can even optimize/reduce the original benchmarks' area, in particular for larger circuits, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of NetDeTox.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00119v1\n    "}}

Using it, we show that the scrambling speed of a random quantum circuit is lower bounded: Namely, every input qubit has an influence that is at least inverse exponential in depth, on any output qubit touched by its lightcone. Our result on scrambling speed works with high probability over the choice of a circuit from an ensemble, as opposed to just working in expectation.\n  As an application, we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning log-depth random quantum circuits with Haar random gates up to polynomially small diamond distance, given oracle access to the circuit.

Despite their ubiquitous use and reliability, CANs are susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly masquerade attacks, which inject false data that mimic legitimate messages at the expected frequency. These attacks pose severe risks such as unintended acceleration, brake deactivation, and rogue steering. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to detect these subtle intrusions due to their seamless integration into normal traffic. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting masquerade attacks in the CAN bus using graph machine learning (ML). We hypothesize that the integration of shallow graph embeddings with time series features derived from CAN frames enhances the detection of masquerade attacks. We show that by representing CAN bus frames as message sequence graphs (MSGs) and enriching each node with contextual statistical attributes from time series, we can enhance detection capabilities across various attack patterns compared to using graph-based features only. Our method ensures a comprehensive and dynamic analysis of CAN frame interactions, improving robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ROAD dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in the detection rates of masquerade attacks compared to a baseline that uses graph-based features only as confirmed by Mann-Whitney U and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests p < 0.05.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05427v2\n    "}}

Our analyses consistently show that AI's capabilities and applications in attacks have exceeded those on the defensive side. Our empirical evaluation of widely used agent systems on cybersecurity benchmarks highlights that current AI agents struggle with flexible workflow planning and using domain-specific tools for complex security analysis -- capabilities particularly critical for defensive applications. Our expert survey of AI and security researchers and practitioners indicates a prevailing view that AI will continue to benefit attackers over defenders, though the gap is expected to narrow over time. These results show the urgent need to evaluate and mitigate frontier AI's risks, steering it towards benefiting cyber defenses. Responding to this need, we provide concrete calls to action regarding: the construction of new cybersecurity benchmarks, the development of AI agents for defense, the design of provably secure AI agents, the improvement of pre-deployment security testing and transparency, and the strengthening of user-oriented education and defenses.

There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\u00fcders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13689v4\n    "}}

This growing adoption underscores the need to ensure their security and robustness. In this work, we focus on the impact of Bit Flip Attacks (BFAs) on LLMs, which exploits hardware faults to corrupt model parameters, posing a significant threat to model integrity and performance. Existing studies on BFA against LLMs adopt a progressive bit-search strategy that predominantly relies on gradient-based techniques to identify sensitive layers or weights. However, computing gradients comes with two specific challenges: First, in the context of LLMs, it increases computational and memory costs exponentially, and Second, it requires access to a sample victim dataset or knowledge of the victim domain to compute the gradient. In this work, we investigate beyond the scope of attack efficacy and aim to develop an efficient, practical Gradient-Data-free Bit-Flip Attack. The challenge lies in the core principle of adversarial attacks, which relies heavily on computing gradients from sample test/train data and manipulating model weights based on gradient information. To overcome this, we propose novel vulnerability index metrics that can identify vulnerable weight bits in LLMs independent of any gradient or data knowledge. By removing the dependency on gradient computation, our approach drastically reduces memory requirements and scales efficiently across multiple tasks with constant complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our method, requiring as few as a single bit flip to achieve adversarial objectives for five open-source LLMs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22700v1\n    "}}

The core idea is to use a decoder for a given code to find short codewords in its dual. For example, Jordan et al. demonstrated how structured codes can be used in this framework to exhibit some quantum advantage. In particular, they showed how the classical decodability of Reed-Solomon codes can be leveraged to solve the Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) problem quantumly. This approach was further improved by Chailloux and Tillich using stronger soft decoders, though their analysis was restricted to a specific setting of OPI. In this work, we reconcile these two approaches. We build on a recent formulation of the reduction by Chailloux and Hermouet in the lattice-based setting, which we rewrite in the language of codes. With this reduction, we show that the results of Jordan et al. can be recovered under Bernoulli noise models, simplifying the analysis. This characterization then allows us to integrate the stronger soft decoders of Chailloux and Tillich into the OPI framework, yielding improved algorithms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22691v1\n    "}}

With the emergence of innovative defensive solutions that place system- and algorithm-level checks and corrections in the input and weight spaces, these perturbations are increasingly susceptible to defenses. This work develops a novel perspective on Trojan attacks that generates an attacker-designed model output while leaving no attack traces on the inputs or weights. Such an attack space can be unlocked through corruption of the key-value (KV) cache. In this paper, we introduce CacheTrap, a novel Trojan attack that corrupts the value vectors stored in the KV cache. These vectors capture the dynamic activations for specific token positions and therefore constitute a natural surface for transient, inference-time trigger insertion. The transient nature of these KV values and their dependence on victim input imply additional constraints on our attack, such as a lack of knowledge of the victim's data or domain application, and, consequently, a lack of gradient information. The objective of the proposed CacheTrap is to develop a vulnerable KV bit-searching algorithm so that, once the attack employs the identified bit-flip as a trigger, the model generates targeted behavior, e.g., classifying inputs towards the target class. Moreover, CacheTrap is a data- and gradient-free attack which also has no impact on the model's utility. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed attack enables the first successful Trojan attack on LLMs with a single bit flip in the KV cache. In addition, the data-independent nature of the attack ensures that once the attacker identifies the vulnerable bit index, the location remains constant and can be transferred to a wide range of victim tasks/datasets/queries with no overhead.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22681v1\n    "}}

While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way:\n  Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities.\n  Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration.\n  Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16943v2\n    "}}

Traditional centralized ML struggles to overcome these challenges, which has led to the rise of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local raw data. FL ensures data privacy, reduces communication overhead, and supports scalability, yet its heterogeneity adds complexity compared to centralized approaches. This survey focuses on three main FL research directions: personalization, optimization, and robustness, offering a structured classification through a hybrid methodology that combines bibliometric analysis with systematic review to identify the most influential works. We examine challenges and techniques related to heterogeneity, efficiency, security, and privacy, and provide a comprehensive overview of aggregation strategies, including architectures, synchronization methods, and diverse federation objectives. To complement this, we discuss practical evaluation approaches and present experiments comparing aggregation methods under IID and non-IID data distributions. Finally, we outline promising research directions to advance FL, aiming to guide future innovation in this rapidly evolving field.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22616v1\n    "}}

Nowadays, agents are undergoing a new round of evolution. They no longer act as an isolated island like LLMs. Instead, they start to communicate with diverse external entities, such as other agents and tools, to perform complex tasks. Under this trend, agent communication is regarded as a foundational pillar of the next communication era, and many organizations have intensively begun to design related communication protocols (e.g., Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A) within the past year. However, this new field exposes significant security hazards, which can cause severe damage to real-world scenarios. To help researchers quickly figure out this promising topic and benefit the future agent communication development, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of agent communication security. More precisely, we present the first clear definition of agent communication. Besides, we propose a framework that categorizes agent communication into three classes and uses a three-layered communication architecture to illustrate how each class works. Next, for each communication class, we dissect related communication protocols and analyze the security risks, illustrating which communication layer the risks arise from. Then, we provide an outlook on the possible defense countermeasures for each risk. In addition, we conduct experiments using MCP and A2A to help readers better understand the novel vulnerabilities brought by agent communication. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions in this promising research field.

However, the stateless nature of LLMs makes managing user context (e.g., sessions, preferences) across geo-distributed edge nodes challenging. Existing solutions, such as client-side context storage, often introduce network latency and bandwidth overhead, undermining the advantages of edge deployment.\n  We propose DisCEdge, a distributed context management system that stores and replicates user context in tokenized form across edge nodes. By maintaining context as token sequences rather than raw text, our system avoids redundant computation and enables efficient data replication. We implement and evaluate an open-source prototype in a realistic edge environment with commodity hardware. We show DisCEdge improves median response times by up to 14.46% and lowers median inter-node synchronization overhead by up to 15% compared to a raw-text-based system. It also reduces client request sizes by a median of 90% compared to client-side context management, while guaranteeing data consistency.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22599v1\n    "}}

While some approaches exist for automating this task, most focus on the simple case of unitary circuits. At the same time, real quantum computing requires hybrid circuits equipped with measurement operators. Moreover, the few approaches targeting the hybrid case are limited to a restricted class of problems. We propose tackling the Quantum Hybrid Circuit Equivalence Checking problem through lifting unitary circuit verification using a transformation known as deferred measurement. We show that this approach alone significantly outperforms prior work, and that, with the addition of specific unitary-level techniques we call separation and projection, it can handle much larger classes of hybrid circuit equivalence problems.

This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with no accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16420v2\n    "}}

State-of-the-art methods alleviate such overhead in parallel diffusion inference through computation-communication overlapping, termed displaced parallelism. However, we identify that these techniques induce severe *staleness*-the usage of outdated activations from previous timesteps that significantly degrades quality, especially in expert-parallel scenarios. We tackle this fundamental tension and propose DICE, a staleness-centric optimization framework with a three-fold approach: (1) Interweaved Parallelism introduces staggered pipelines, effectively halving step-level staleness for free; (2) Selective Synchronization operates at layer-level and protects layers vulnerable from staled activations; and (3) Conditional Communication, a token-level, training-free method that dynamically adjusts communication frequency based on token importance. Together, these strategies effectively reduce staleness, achieving 1.26x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Empirical results establish DICE as an effective and scalable solution.

We introduce OmniInfer, a unified system-level acceleration framework designed to maximize end-to-end serving efficiency through fine-grained optimization of expert placement, cache compression, and scheduling. OmniInfer integrates three complementary components: OmniPlacement for load-aware Mixture-of-Experts scheduling, OmniAttn for sparse attention acceleration, and OmniProxy for disaggregation-aware request scheduling. Built atop vLLM, OmniInfer delivers system-wide performance gains through adaptive resource disaggregation, efficient sparsity exploitation, and global coordination across prefill and decode phases. Evaluated on DeepSeek-R1 within a 10-node Ascend 910C cluster, OmniInfer achieves 616 QPM, where the unified framework reduces TPOT by 36\\%, and the superimposition of OmniProxy further slashes TTFT by 38\\%.

RIPE Atlas boasts over 12.9K vantage points in 178 countries worldwide and serves as a vital tool for analyzing anycast deployment, network latency, and topology, to name a few. Despite generating over a terabyte of measurement results per day, there is limited understanding of the underlying processes. This paper delves into one day in the life of RIPE Atlas, encompassing 50.9K unique measurements and over 1.3 billion results. While most daily measurements are user-defined, it is built-ins and anchor meshes that account for 89% of produced results. We extensively examine how different probes and measurements contribute to the daily operations of RIPE Atlas and consider any bias they may introduce. Furthermore, we demonstrate how existing measurements can be leveraged to investigate censorship, traceroute symmetry, and the usage of reserved address blocks, among others. Finally, we curate a set of recommendations for researchers using the RIPE Atlas platform to foster transparency, reproducibility, and ethics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22474v1\n    "}}

While early geolocation methods required expert effort and lacked generalization, the rise of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) now enables accurate geolocation even for ordinary users. However, existing approaches are not optimized for this task. To explore the full potential and associated privacy risks, we present Geo-Detective, an agent that mimics human reasoning and tool use for image geolocation inference. It follows a procedure with four steps that adaptively selects strategies based on image difficulty and is equipped with specialized tools such as visual reverse search, which emulates how humans gather external geographic clues. Experimental results show that GEO-Detective outperforms baseline large vision language models (LVLMs) overall, particularly on images lacking visible geographic features. In country level geolocation tasks, it achieves an improvement of over 11.1% compared to baseline LLMs, and even at finer grained levels, it still provides around a 5.2% performance gain. Meanwhile, when equipped with external clues, GEO-Detective becomes more likely to produce accurate predictions, reducing the \"unknown\" prediction rate by more than 50.6%. We further explore multiple defense strategies and find that Geo-Detective exhibits stronger robustness, highlighting the need for more effective privacy safeguards.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22441v1\n    "}}

To date, several approaches have been proposed based on the Residue Number System variant of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme. However, they all suffer from high latency, which severely limits the applications in real-world tasks. Currently, the research on encrypted inference in deep CNNs confronts three main bottlenecks: i) the time and storage costs of convolution calculation; ii) the time overhead of huge bootstrapping operations; and iii) the consumption of circuit multiplication depth. Towards these three challenges, we in this paper propose an efficient and effective mechanism FastFHE to accelerate the model inference while simultaneously retaining high inference accuracy over fully homomorphic encryption. Concretely, our work elaborates four unique novelties. First, we propose a new scalable ciphertext data-packing scheme to save the time and storage consumptions. Second, we work out a depthwise-separable convolution fashion to degrade the computation load of convolution calculation. Third, we figure out a BN dot-product fusion matrix to merge the ciphertext convolutional layer with the batch-normalization layer without incurring extra multiplicative depth. Last but not least, we adopt the low-degree Legendre polynomial to approximate the nonlinear smooth activation function SiLU under the guarantee of tiny accuracy error before and after encrypted inference. Finally, we execute multi-facet experiments to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22434v1\n    "}}

However, the integration of diffusion models faces critical challenges into resource-constrained mobile and edge environments because it requires multiple denoising steps from the original random noise. A practical way to speed up denoising is to initialize the process with a noised reference image that is similar to the target, since both images share similar layouts, structures, and details, allowing for fewer denoising steps. Based on this idea, we present CacheGenius, a hybrid image generation system in edge computing that accelerates generation by combining text-toimage and image-to-image workflows. It generates images from user text prompts using cached reference images. CacheGenius introduces a semantic-aware classified storage scheme and a request-scheduling algorithm that ensures semantic alignment between references and targets. To ensure sustained performance, it employs a cache maintenance policy that proactively evicts obsolete entries via correlation analysis. Evaluated in a distributed edge computing system, CacheGenius reduces generation latency by 41% and computational costs by 48% relative to baselines, while maintaining competitive evaluation metrics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22421v1\n    "}}

Existing instantiations, however, typically rely on classical signature schemes whose long-term security is threatened by quantum-capable adversaries. In this paper we formalize security notions for evidence structures in the presence of quantum adversaries and study post-quantum (PQ) instantiations and migration strategies for deployed audit logs. We recall an abstraction of constant-size evidence structures and introduce game-based definitions of Q-Audit Integrity, Q-Non-Equivocation, and Q-Binding, capturing the inability of a quantum adversary to forge, equivocate, or rebind evidence items. We then analyze a hash-and-sign instantiation in the quantum random-oracle model (QROM), assuming an existentially unforgeable PQ signature scheme against quantum adversaries, and show that the resulting evidence structure satisfies these notions under standard assumptions. Building on this, we present three migration patterns for existing evidence logs: hybrid signatures, re-signing of legacy evidence, and Merkle-root anchoring, and analyze their security, storage, and computational trade-offs. A case study based on an industrial constant-size evidence platform for regulated AI at Codebat Technologies Inc. suggests that quantum-safe audit trails are achievable with moderate overhead and that systematic migration can significantly extend the evidentiary lifetime of existing deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00110v1\n    "}}

Since real-world networks cannot be fully Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)-enabled due to infrastructure constraints, practical security solutions must support hybrid operation. This paper presents an adaptive security framework that enables quantum-safe communications across real-world heterogeneous networks by combining QKD and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Building upon a hierarchical key management architecture with Virtual Key Management Systems (vKMS) and a centralized Quantum Security Controller (QuSeC), the framework dynamically assigns security levels based on node capabilities. By transitioning between pure QKD, hybrid, and PQC modes, it ensures end-to-end quantum-safe protection regardless of the underlying node capabilities. The framework has been implemented and validated on a Kubernetes-based containerized testbed, demonstrating robust operation and performance across all scenarios. Results highlight its potential to support the gradual integration of quantum-safe technologies into existing infrastructures, paving the way toward fully quantum-safe communication networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22416v1\n    "}}

However, this reliance on reward signals creates a significant security vulnerability. In this paper, we study a stealthy backdoor attack that manipulates an agent's policy by poisoning its reward signals.

As these models are costly to train and \\emph{evaluate}, reducing the inference cost for diffusion models remains a major goal. Inspired by the recent empirical success in accelerating diffusion models via the parallel sampling technique~\\cite{shih2024parallel}, we propose to divide the sampling process into $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks with parallelizable Picard iterations within each block. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{poly} \\log d)$ overall time complexity, marking \\emph{the first implementation with provable sub-linear complexity w.r.t. the data dimension $d$}. Our analysis is based on a generalized version of Girsanov's theorem and is compatible with both the SDE and probability flow ODE implementations. Our results shed light on the potential of fast and efficient sampling of high-dimensional data on fast-evolving modern large-memory GPU clusters.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15986v2\n    "}}

Alpturer, Halpern, and van der Meyden (PODC 2023) introduced the notion of optimality with respect to a limited information exchange, and studied the Eventual Agreement problem in the sending omissions failure model. The present paper studies the Simultaneous Agreement problem for the crash failures model, and a number of limited information exchanges from the literature. In particular, the paper considers information exchanges from a FloodSet protocol (Lynch, Distributed Algorithms 1996), a variant of this in which agents also count the number of failures (Casta\u00f1eda et al, NETYS 2017), and a variant in which agents associate each agent with a value (Raynal, PRDC 2002). A new information exchange is also introduced that enables decisions to be made at worst one round later than the optimal protocol of Dwork and Moses (I&C 88), but with lower computation cost and space requirements. By determining implementations of a knowledge based program, protocols are derived that are optimal amongst protocols for each of these information exchanges.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22380v1\n    "}}

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is effective for identifying dependencies and mitigating security risks. However, existing SBOM solutions lack precision, particularly in binary analysis and non-package-managed languages like C/C++.\n  This paper introduces UniBOM, an advanced tool for SBOM generation, analysis, and visualisation, designed to enhance the security accountability of networked systems. UniBOM integrates binary, filesystem, and source code analysis, enabling fine-grained vulnerability detection and risk management. Key features include historical CPE tracking, AI-based vulnerability classification by severity and memory safety, and support for non-package-managed C/C++ dependencies.\n  UniBOM's effectiveness is demonstrated through a comparative vulnerability analysis of 258 wireless router firmware binaries and the source code of four popular IoT operating systems, highlighting its superior detection capabilities compared to other widely used SBOM generation and analysis tools. Packaged for open-source distribution, UniBOM offers an end-to-end unified analysis and visualisation solution, advancing SBOM-driven security management for dependable networked systems and broader software.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22359v1\n    "}}

Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.\n  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22333v1\n    "}}

Routing entanglement in quantum networks poses several fundamental as well as technical challenges, including the high dynamicity of quantum network links and the probabilistic nature of quantum operations. Consequently, designing hand-crafted heuristics is difficult and often leads to suboptimal performance, especially if global network topology information is unavailable.\n  In this paper, we propose RELiQ, a reinforcement learning-based approach to entanglement routing that only relies on local information and iterative message exchange. Utilizing a graph neural network, RELiQ learns graph representations and avoids overfitting to specific network topologies - a prevalent issue for learning-based approaches. Our approach, trained on random graphs, consistently outperforms existing local information heuristics and learning-based approaches when applied to random and real-world topologies. When compared to global information heuristics, our method achieves similar or superior performance because of its rapid response to topology changes.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22321v1\n    "}}

Rollups improve transaction throughput by processing operations off-chain and posting the results on-chain. A critical component in Rollups is the Sequencer, responsible for receiving, ordering and batching transactions before they are submitted to the Layer-1 blockchain. While essential, the centralized nature of the Sequencer makes it vulnerable to attacks, such as censorship, transaction manipulation and tampering. To enhance its security, there are solutions in the literature that shield the Sequencer inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). However, the attestation of TEEs introduces additional centralization, which is in contrast with the core Blockchain principle. In this paper, we propose a TEE-secured Sequencer equipped with a decentralized attestation mechanism. We outline the design and implementation of our solution, covering the system architecture, TEE integration, and the decentralization of the attestation process. Additionally, we present an experimental evaluation conducted on a realistic Rollup testnet. Our results show that this approach strengthens Sequencer integrity without sacrificing compatibility or deployability in existing Layer-2 architectures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22317v1\n    "}}

However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22302v1\n    "}}

To reach their full potential, CV platforms need to be able to efficiently implement non-Gaussian operations. However, schemes for generating arbitrary non-Gaussian operations are restricted to single modes, i.e., the implementation of anharmonic potentials. Here, we introduce a method for implementing arbitrary non-Gaussian operations applicable to both single- and multi-mode systems, allowing the generation of both anharmonicities and nonlinear multi-mode couplings. Our method synthesizes a target Hamiltonian by decomposing it into a Fourier series whose terms are implemented via bosonic quantum signal processing, which uses a discrete-variable (DV) system to induce a nonlinearity in the CV system. Our hybrid CV-DV protocol allows for the direct simulation of a broad range of CV phenomena (such as those in lattice gauge theory, chemical dynamics, and quantum chaos) and provides a richer toolbox for CV circuit compilation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22286v1\n    "}}

Among these, a novel paradigm called History Covert Channels (HCC) leverages past network events as reference points to embed covert messages. Unlike traditional timing- or storage-based CCs, which directly manipulate traffic patterns or packet contents, HCCs minimize detectability by encoding information through small pointers to historical data. This approach enables them to amplify the size of transmitted covert data by referring to more bits than are actually embedded. Recent research has explored the feasibility of such methods, demonstrating their potential to evade detection by repurposing naturally occurring network behaviors as a covert transmission medium.\n  This paper introduces a novel method for establishing and maintaining covert communication links using relative pointers to network timing patterns, which minimizes the reliance of the HCC on centralized timekeeping and reduces the likelihood of being detected by standard network monitoring tools. We also explore the tailoring of HCCs to optimize their robustness and undetectability characteristics. Our experiments reveal a better bitrate compared to previous work.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22259v1\n    "}}

One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15591v2\n    "}}

The parity architecture can be understood as an LDPC code tailored specifically to obtain any desired logical connectivity from nearest-neighbor physical interactions. The code layout can be dynamically adjusted to algorithmic requirements on-the-fly. This allows for implementations with any desired code distance with a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. In addition to the previously explored tool-sets for concatenated cat codes, our approach features parallelizable interactions between arbitrary sets of qubits by directly addressing the parity qubits in the code. The proposed scheme enables codes with less physical qubit overhead compared to the repetition code with the same code distances, while requiring only weight-3 and weight-4 stabilizers and nearest-neighbor 2D square-lattice connectivity.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11332v2\n    "}}

In contrast, complex requests often require the superior capability of cloud models, incurring higher latency and cost. To navigate this quality-cost trade-off under dynamic network conditions, we propose a cloud-edge synergy for NetGPT that integrates network-aware routing with on-edge self-improvement. Specifically, our framework routes structured tool-calling requests to cloud or edge agents via a novel scoring policy. We prove that, under mild regularity assumptions, the optimal routing rule admits a unique fallback threshold with monotone dependence on bandwidth and round-trip time (RTT). Concurrently, based on the dataset collected from requests routed to the cloud and corresponding responses, we instantiate a schema-preserving reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the capability of the edge agent. We analyze a supervised finetuning (SFT)-anchored composite objective that combines a reverse-KL trust-region step with a forward-KL realignment toward the SFT prior, explaining stability and constraining policy drift. Both the network-aware routing policy and the edge agent are updated coherently. Experiments across controlled network states and pricing schedules demonstrate smooth quality-cost frontiers, consistent gains of dynamic fallback thresholds over fixed policies, and sustained reductions in offloading while maintaining task success and schema-correct outputs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22217v1\n    "}}

Therefore, it is imperative to research the classification of the newly registered Pornographic and Gambling Domain Names (PGDN). However, scholarly investigation into this topic is limited. Previous efforts in PGDN classification pursue high accuracy using ideal sample data, while others employ up-to-date data from real-world scenarios but achieve lower classification accuracy. This paper introduces the Real-PGDN method, which accomplishes a complete process of timely and comprehensive real-data crawling, feature extraction with feature-missing tolerance, precise PGDN classification, and assessment of application effects in actual scenarios. Our two-level classifier, which integrates CoSENT (BERT-based), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and traditional classification algorithms, achieves a 97.88% precision. The research process amasses the NRD2024 dataset, which contains continuous detection information over 20 days for 1,500,000 newly registered domain names across 6 directions. Results from our case study demonstrate that this method also maintains a forecast precision of over 70% for PGDN that are delayed in usage after registration.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22215v1\n    "}}

To address this problem, organizations rely on security awareness programs, which aim to make employees more resilient against social engineering. While some works have suggested that such programs should account for contextual relevance, the common praxis in research is to adopt a \"general\" viewpoint. For instance, instead of focusing on department-specific issues, prior user studies sought to provide organization-wide conclusions. Such a protocol may lead to overlooking vulnerabilities that affect only specific subsets of an organization.\n  In this paper, we tackle such an oversight. First, through a systematic literature review, we provide evidence that prior literature poorly accounted for department-specific needs. Then, we carry out a multi-company and mixed-methods study focusing on two pivotal departments: human resources (HR) and accounting. We explore three dimensions: threats faced by these departments; topics covered in the security-awareness campaigns delivered to these departments; and delivery methods that maximize the effectiveness of such campaigns. We begin by interviewing 16 employees of a multinational enterprise, and then use these results as a scaffold to design a structured survey through which we collect the responses of over 90 HR/accounting members of 9 organizations. We find that HR is targeted through job applications containing malware and executive impersonation, while accounting is exposed to invoice fraud, credential theft, and ransomware. Current training is often viewed as too generic, with employees preferring shorter, scenario-based formats like videos and simulations. These preferences contradict the common industry practice of annual sessions. Based on these insights, we propose recommendations for designing awareness programs tailored to departmental needs and workflows.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22189v1\n    "}}

However, existing research has not fully addressed the risk of attackers exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of 3D spatiotemporal trajectories and the impact of height information, both of which can potentially lead to significant privacy leakage. To address these issues, this paper proposes a personalized 3D spatiotemporal trajectory privacy protection mechanism, named 3DSTPM. First, we analyze the characteristics of attackers that exploit spatiotemporal correlations between locations in a trajectory and present the attack model. Next, we exploit the complementary characteristics of 3D geo-indistinguishability (3D-GI) and distortion privacy to find a protection location set (PLS) that obscures the real location for all possible locations. To address the issue of privacy accumulation caused by continuous trajectory queries, we propose a Window-based Adaptive Privacy Budget Allocation (W-APBA), which dynamically allocates privacy budgets to all locations in the current PLS based on their predictability and sensitivity. Finally, we perturb the real location using the allocated privacy budget by the PF (Permute-and-Flip) mechanism, effectively balancing privacy protection and Quality of Service (QoS). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 3DSTPM effectively reduces QoS loss while meeting the user's personalized privacy protection needs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22180v1\n    "}}

Recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in this pipeline and introduced computation cost attacks that lead to malicious resource occupancies and even denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, thereby hindering the reliable deployment of 3DGS. In this paper, we propose the first effective and comprehensive black-box defense framework, named RemedyGS, against such computation cost attacks, safeguarding 3DGS reconstruction systems and services. Our pipeline comprises two key components: a detector to identify the attacked input images with poisoned textures and a purifier to recover the benign images from their attacked counterparts, mitigating the adverse effects of these attacks. Moreover, we incorporate adversarial training into the purifier to enforce distributional alignment between the recovered and original natural images, thereby enhancing the defense efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively defends against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks in 3DGS systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both safety and utility.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22147v1\n    "}}

Due to the transmission of very high-dimensional gradient updates from many clients, FL is known to suffer from a communication bottleneck. Meanwhile, the gradients shared by clients as well as the trained model may also be exploited for inferring private local datasets, making privacy still a critical concern in FL. We present Clover, a novel system framework for communication-efficient, secure, and differentially private FL. To tackle the communication bottleneck in FL, Clover follows a standard and commonly used approach-top-k gradient sparsification, where each client sparsifies its gradient update such that only k largest gradients (measured by magnitude) are preserved for aggregation. Clover provides a tailored mechanism built out of a trending distributed trust setting involving three servers, which allows to efficiently aggregate multiple sparse vectors (top-k sparsified gradient updates) into a dense vector while hiding the values and indices of non-zero elements in each sparse vector. This mechanism outperforms a baseline built on the general distributed ORAM technique by several orders of magnitude in server-side communication and runtime, with also smaller client communication cost. We further integrate this mechanism with a lightweight distributed noise generation mechanism to offer differential privacy (DP) guarantees on the trained model. To harden Clover with security against a malicious server, we devise a series of lightweight mechanisms for integrity checks on the server-side computation. Extensive experiments show that Clover can achieve utility comparable to vanilla FL with central DP, with promising performance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07123v2\n    "}}

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20172v2\n    "}}

However, its computational demands on large-scale datasets often require outsourcing to external computing services, raising concerns about the leakage of sensitive information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to enhance data security and privacy in FCA-based computations. Specifically, we introduce a Privacy-preserving Formal Context Analysis (PFCA) framework that combines binary data representation with homomorphic encryption techniques. This method enables secure and efficient concept construction without revealing private data. Experimental results and security analysis confirm the effectiveness of our approach in preserving privacy while maintaining computational performance. These findings have important implications for privacy-preserving data mining and secure knowledge discovery in large-scale FCA applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22117v1\n    "}}

Today, existing datasets target single platforms, require specialized tooling, or provide only hand-engineered features incompatible with modern neural architectures; no single dataset supports accessible research and pedagogy on realistic use cases. To solve this, we introduce Binary-30K, the first heterogeneous binary dataset designed for sequence-based models like transformers. Critically, Binary-30K covers Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android across 15+ CPU architectures. With 29,793 binaries and approximately 26.93% malware representation, Binary-30K enables research on platform-invariant detection, cross-target transfer learning, and long-context binary understanding. The dataset provides pre-computed byte-level BPE tokenization alongside comprehensive structural metadata, supporting both sequence modeling and structure-aware approaches. Platform-first stratified sampling ensures representative coverage across operating systems and architectures, while distribution via Hugging Face with official train/validation/test splits enables reproducible benchmarking. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mjbommar/binary-30k, providing an accessible resource for researchers, practitioners, and students alike.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22095v1\n    "}}

Treating the longitudinal coordinate $z$ as an evolution parameter (propagation distance), we construct the propagator, evaluate the Bures distance, and obtain analytic Mandelstam--Tamm and Margolus--Levitin bounds that fix a propagation-distance limit $z_{\\mathrm{PDL}}$ to reach a prescribed mode distinguishability. This distance-domain constraint is the classical optical analogue of the minimal orthogonality time in quantum mechanics. We then propose a compact self-defocusing PDL beam shaper that achieves strong transverse-mode conversion within millimeter scales. We further show that small variations in refractive index, beam power, or temperature shift $z_{\\mathrm{SL}}$ with high leverage, enabling speed-limit-based metrology with index sensitivities down to $10^{-7}$ RIU and temperature resolutions of order $1$ mK. The results bridge distance-domain QSL geometry and practical photonic applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22085v1\n    "}}

We propose an adiabatic pumping scheme for the long-range transfer of topological corner states in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The protocol utilizes a modular lattice architecture composed of four topologically distinct subblocks, enabling the modulation of a topological dark state by precise tuning of lattice couplings. This approach is based on coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage among topological corner and interface states. We establish a multi-level model for the adiabatic pumping that provides an accurate description of the underlying mechanism. In comparison with a sequential two-stage Thouless pumping, our protocol offers superior performance in both transfer fidelity and efficiency.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22083v1\n    "}}

These twin requirements have naturally led to two widely used techniques: client/server \\emph{momentum} to accelerate progress, and \\emph{sharpness-aware minimization} (SAM) to prefer flat solutions. However, simply combining momentum and SAM leaves two structural issues unresolved in non-IID FL. We identify and formalize two failure modes: \\emph{local-global curvature misalignment} (local SAM directions need not reflect the global loss geometry) and \\emph{momentum-echo oscillation} (late-stage instability caused by accumulated momentum). To our knowledge, these failure modes have not been jointly articulated and addressed in the FL literature. We propose \\textbf{FedWMSAM} to address both failure modes. First, we construct a momentum-guided global perturbation from server-aggregated momentum to align clients' SAM directions with the global descent geometry, enabling a \\emph{single-backprop} SAM approximation that preserves efficiency. Second, we couple momentum and SAM via a cosine-similarity adaptive rule, yielding an early-momentum, late-SAM two-phase training schedule. We provide a non-IID convergence bound that \\emph{explicitly models the perturbation-induced variance} $\u03c3_\u03c1^2=\u03c3^2+(L\u03c1)^2$ and its dependence on $(S, K, R, N)$ on the theory side. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures, and the results validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of our method, demonstrating its superiority in addressing the optimization challenges of Federated Learning.

This study evaluated ten publicly available guardrail models from Meta, Google, IBM, NVIDIA, Alibaba, and Allen AI across 1,445 test prompts spanning 21 attack categories. While Qwen3Guard-8B achieved the highest overall accuracy (85.3%, 95% CI: 83.4-87.1%), a critical finding emerged when separating public benchmark prompts from novel attacks: all models showed substantial performance degradation on unseen prompts, with Qwen3Guard dropping from 91.0% to 33.8% (a 57.2 percentage point gap). In contrast, Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B showed the best generalization with only a 6.5% gap. A \"helpful mode\" jailbreak was also discovered where two guardrail models (Nemotron-Safety-8B, Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B) generated harmful content instead of blocking it, representing a novel failure mode. These findings suggest that benchmark performance may be misleading due to training data contamination, and that generalization ability, not overall accuracy, should be the primary metric for guardrail evaluation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22047v1\n    "}}

In this paper, we first conduct a large-scale measurement study with up to 50 million live streams. We find that loss shows dynamics and live streaming contains frequent on-off mode switching in the wild. We further find that the recovery latency, enlarged by the ubiquitous retransmission loss, is a critical factor affecting live streaming's client-side QoE (e.g., video freezing). We then propose an enhanced recovery mechanism called AutoRec, which can transform the disadvantages of on-off mode switching into an advantage for reducing loss recovery latency without any modifications on the client side. AutoRec allows users to customize overhead tolerance and recovery latency tolerance and adaptively adjusts strategies as the network environment changes to ensure that recovery latency meets user demands whenever possible while keeping overhead under control. We implement AutoRec upon QUIC and evaluate it via testbed and real-world commercial services deployments. The experimental results demonstrate the practicability and profitability of AutoRec.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22046v1\n    "}}

This work investigates the distillability of an LLM's core security logic. We propose a novel framework that incorporates an improved outline filling attack to achieve dense sampling of the model's security boundaries. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking regression paradigm that replaces standard regression and trains the proxy model to predict which prompt yields a higher ASR. Experimental results show that our proxy model achieves an accuracy of 91.1 percent in predicting the relative ranking of average long response (ALR), and 69.2 percent in predicting ASR. These findings confirm the predictability and distillability of jailbreak behaviors, and demonstrate the potential of leveraging such distillability to optimize black-box attacks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22044v1\n    "}}

Conventional cyber defenses assume rational, utility-maximizing attackers, yet real-world adversaries exhibit cognitive constraints and biases that shape their interactions with complex digital systems. GAMBiT embeds insights from cognitive science into cyber environments through cognitive triggers, which activate biases such as loss aversion, base-rate neglect, and sunk-cost fallacy, and through newly developed cognitive sensors that infer attackers' cognitive states from behavioral and network data. Three rounds of human-subject experiments (total n=61) in a simulated small business network demonstrate that these manipulations significantly disrupt attacker performance, reducing mission progress, diverting actions off the true attack path, and increasing detectability. These results demonstrate that cognitive biases can be systematically triggered to degrade the attacker's efficiency and enhance the defender's advantage. GAMBiT establishes a new paradigm in which the attacker's mind becomes part of the battlefield and cognitive manipulation becomes a proactive vector for cyber defense.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00098v1\n    "}}

We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20922v2\n    "}}

Cross-domain access control involves access to resources across different organizations, institutions, or applications. Traditional access control, however, which handles authentication and authorization separately in centralized environments, faces challenges in identity dispersion, privacy leakage, and diversified permission requirements, failing to adapt to cross-domain scenarios. Thus, there is an urgent need for a new access control mechanism that empowers autonomous control over user identity and resources, addressing the demands for privacy-preserving authentication and flexible authorization in cross-domain scenarios. To address cross-domain access control challenges, we propose POLARIS, a unified and extensible architecture that enables policy-based, verifiable and privacy-preserving access control across different domains. POLARIS features a structured commitment mechanism for reliable, fine-grained, policy-based identity disclosure. It further introduces VPPL, a lightweight policy language that supports issuer-bound evaluation of selectively revealed attributes. A dedicated session-level security mechanism ensures binding between authentication and access, enhancing confidentiality and resilience to replay attacks. We implement a working prototype and conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that POLARIS effectively provides scalable, privacy-preserving, and interoperable access control across heterogeneous domains. Our results highlight the practical viability of POLARIS for enabling secure and privacy-preserving access control in decentralized, cross-domain environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22017v1\n    "}}

Currently, users cannot securely associate digital assets with their related physical space, leading to problems such as fake brand stores, property fraud, and mobile payment scams. In many cases, the necessary information to protect digital assets exists, e.g., via contractual relationships and cadaster entries, but there is currently no uniform way of retrieving and verifying these documents. In this work, we propose the Geo-Enabled Cryptographic Key Oracle (GECKO), a geographical PKI that provides a global view of digital assets based on their geo-location and occupied space. GECKO allows for the bidirectional translation of trust between the physical and digital world. Users can verify which assets are supposed to exist at their location, as well as verify which physical space is claimed by a digital entity. GECKO supplements current PKI systems and can be used in addition to current systems when its properties are of value. We show the feasibility of efficiently storing millions of assets and serving cryptographic material based on precise location queries within 11 ms at a rate of more than 19000 queries per second on a single server.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21999v1\n    "}}

We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21990v1\n    "}}

Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of abelian number fields with $p$-power Galois group. For an elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{Q}$, we study the Mazur-Tate elements over the finite layers of the cyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ and $L$. We show that the vanishing of the $\u03bc$-invariant is preserved in the extension: if the level-$n$ Mazur-Tate element over $K$ has $\u03bc= 0$, then the corresponding element over $L$ also has $\u03bc= 0$. Moreover, the associated $\u03bb$-invariants satisfy an explicit transition formula. This parallels the work of Hachimori-Matsuno on Selmer groups and of Matsuno on $p$-adic $L$-functions. As an application, we obtain an analogue of Kida's formula for the analytic Iwasawa invariants associated to Pollack's signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. Since our results apply to elliptic curves with any reduction type at $p$ under mild hypotheses, including those with additive reduction, we also obtain a Kida-type formula for the $p$-adic $L$-functions constructed by Delbourgo for elliptic curves with unstable additive reduction. In particular, because Mazur-Tate elements approximate $p$-adic $L$-functions in the limit, our results unify all previously known cases of Kida's formula for analytic Iwasawa invariants.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21979v1\n    "}}

Distributed consensus suffers from performance limitations of network communication between participating nodes. BLOCKY ZipperChain guarantees immutability, agreement, and availability of transaction data, but without relying on distributed consensus. Instead, its construction process transfers trust from widely-used, third-party services onto ZipperChains's correctness guarantees. ZipperChain blocks are built by a pipeline of specialized services deployed on a small number of nodes connected by a fast data center network. As a result, ZipperChain transaction throughput approaches network line speeds and block finality is on the order of 500 ms. Finally, ZipperChain infrastructure creates blocks centrally and so does not need a native token to incentivize a community of verifiers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21969v1\n    "}}

While recent studies in quantum systems suggest that initial conditions play a decisive role in its emergence, they offer limited insight into MPCs in complex, highly nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we investigate temperature dynamics in the strongly coupled, quantum chaotic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which is dual to the low-energy dynamics of 2D dilaton gravity. Our findings reveal a dynamically driven nonequilibrium mechanism underlying MPCs during rapid thermalization, with implications for gravitational systems. We explore quench dynamics in SYK systems under three conditions: coupling to a single SYK thermal bath, coupling to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. We find that strong system-bath coupling induces oscillating effective temperatures and trajectory crossings in transient states due to nonequilibrium statistics, phenomena absent in quasi-static thermodynamics and Lindbladian SYKs. These MPCs highlight a unique feature of anomalous thermalization of strongly coupled quantum chaotic systems driven far from equilibrium. Besides, the results also provide qualitative insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of black holes strongly interacting with their environment, such as primordial black holes in the early universe.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669v3\n    "}}

While reliability imposes timely-throughput requirements, i.e., percentage of packets to be delivered within a prescribed per-packet deadline, resilience relates to the network's ability to swiftly recover timely-throughput performance following an outage event, such as node or link failures. While recent studies have increasingly focused on designing reliable network control policies, a comprehensive solution that combines reliable and resilient network control has yet to be fully explored. This paper formulates the multi-commodity least-cost resilient and reliable network control (MC-LC-ResRNC) problem as a stochastic control problem with long and short-term timely throughput constraints. We then present a solution through the Multi-Commodity Resilient and Reliable Cloud Network Control (MC-ResRCNC) algorithm and show through numerical experiments that it jointly ensures reliability under normal conditions and resilience upon network failure.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21960v1\n    "}}

This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement.

Their affordability and rapid deployment have encouraged the adoption of commercial solutions. However, many rely on insecure protocols such as MAVLink, which lack authentication and encryption mechanisms. This paper designed, implemented, and evaluated a new secure command-and-control architecture that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA) while supporting real-time control delegation between Ground Control Stations (GCSs). The proposed solution, named New Command and Control System (NC2S), enforces a zero-trust model integrating hierarchical credential-based privileges to regulate access and control among Tactical Commanders (TC), GCSs, and UxVs. It employs mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, while message integrity is ensured through Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). Multiple lightweight protocols were developed for credential management, key renewal, and control handover. The NC2S prototype was experimentally validated over Wi-Fi and Rohde&Schwarz HR-5000H tactical radios. Results showed that HR-5000H links introduce latencies roughly two orders of magnitude higher than broadband technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi or 5G&Beyond technologies) but are still able to maintain stable communication with minimal message loss, making them suitable for the NC2S links among TC terminals and GCSs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21936v1\n    "}}

To address this issue, we present Pier, an efficient and scalable optimizer with relaxed global communication. Pier is built upon DiLoCo, which leverages an inner optimizer within groups of processors and an outer optimizer that requires global communication. To preserve the convergence and model performance, Pier incorporates two key techniques for the outer optimizer: momentum warmup and momentum decay. Pier employs an efficient and scalable system architecture to enable complex parallelization strategies in LLM pretraining. We examine the model performance and runtime reduction of Pier using the GPT model family (e.g., small, medium, XL, and 7B) and the OpenWebText dataset with a suite of thirteen downstream tasks. With data parallel strategy, Pier speeds up GPT-2 XL training by up to 2.7x-3.7x on 256 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 1.2x-1.9x on 64 GH200 Superchips, respectively, without degradation of validation loss or downstream task performance. With data parallel and tensor parallel, Pier reduces the time cost GPT-2 7B model training by 54.5% on 128 A100s.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17849v2\n    "}}

A significant \"language barrier\" currently separates technical security teams, who focus on algorithmic vulnerabilities (e.g., MITRE ATLAS), from legal and compliance professionals, who address regulatory mandates (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF). This disciplinary disconnect prevents the accurate translation of technical vulnerabilities into financial liability, leaving practitioners unable to answer fundamental economic questions regarding contingency reserves, control return-on-investment, and insurance exposure. To bridge this gap, this research presents the AI System Threat Vector Taxonomy, a structured ontology designed explicitly for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA). The framework categorizes AI-specific risks into nine critical domains: Misuse, Poisoning, Privacy, Adversarial, Biases, Unreliable Outputs, Drift, Supply Chain, and IP Threat, integrating 53 operationally defined sub-threats. Uniquely, each domain maps technical vectors directly to business loss categories (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Legal, Reputation), enabling the translation of abstract threats into measurable financial impact. The taxonomy is empirically validated through an analysis of 133 documented AI incidents from 2025 (achieving 100% classification coverage) and reconciled against the main AI risk frameworks. Furthermore, it is explicitly aligned with ISO/IEC 42001 controls and NIST AI RMF functions to facilitate auditability.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21901v1\n    "}}

Utilizing distributed cores, each hosting logical data qubits and logical ancillas connected via classical and quantum communication channels, offers a promising alternative. However, building such a system for logical qubits requires additional optimizations, such as minimizing the amount of state transfer between cores for inter-core two-qubit gates and optimizing the routing of magic states distilled in a magic state factory. In this work, we investigate such a system and its statistics in terms of classical and quantum resources. First, we restrict our quantum gate set to a universal gate set consisting of CNOT, H, T, S, and Pauli gates. We then developed a framework that can take any quantum circuit, transpile it to our gate set using Qiskit, and then partition the qubits using the KaHIP graph partitioner to balanced partitions. Afterwards, we built an algorithm to map these graphs onto the 2D mesh of quantum cores by converting the problem into a Quadratic Assignment Problem with Fixed Assignment (QAPFA) to minimize the routing of leftover two-qubit gates between cores and the total travel of magic states from the magic state factory. Following this stage, the gates are scheduled using an algorithm that takes care of the timing of the gate set. As a final stage, our framework reports detailed statistics such as the number of classical communications, the number of EPR pairs and magic states consumed, and timing overheads for pre- and post- processing for inter-core state transfers. These results help to quantify both classical and quantum resources that are used in distributed logical quantum computing architectures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21885v1\n    "}}

Co-locating these workloads on shared serving instances can improve resource utilization, but directly applying this approach to Prefill/Decode (P/D) disaggregated systems introduces severe load imbalance, as fluctuating request mixes alter the intrinsic P/D ratio. Existing dynamic adjustment techniques cannot keep up with the bursty traffic patterns of online services.\n  We propose a latency-constraint disaggregated architecture, which separates cluster resources into latency-strict and latency-relaxed pools based on task latency requirements. This design enables flexible placement of offline decode tasks, mitigating P/D imbalance while preserving online performance. To fully exploit this flexibility, we propose (1) a bottleneck-based scheduler guided by a Roofline-based performance model for performance bottleneck based scheduling, and (2) a fast preemption mechanism that strictly enforces Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for online requests.\n  Experiments on real-world traces show that compared to existing offline system approaches, our method improves offline throughput by up to 3x, while maintaining online request SLOs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21862v1\n    "}}

We show that for $n > 2f$, the two models are equivalent with respect to the solvability of colorless tasks, and that for colored tasks the equivalence holds only when $f = 1$ (and $n > 2$). The separation for larger $f$ arises from the presence of silenced processes in $\\operatorname{HO}_f$, which may lead to incompatible decisions. The proofs proceed through bidirectional simulations between $\\operatorname{AMP}_f$ and $\\operatorname{HO}_f$ via an intermediate model that captures this notion of silencing. The results extend to randomized protocols against a non-adaptive adversary, indicating that the expressive limits of canonical rounds are structural rather than probabilistic. Together, these results delineate precisely where round-based abstractions capture asynchronous computation, and where they do not.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21859v1\n    "}}

Yet, these domains often demand hefty computational power, translating to substantial energy usage and potentially sidelining less robust computing systems. It's evident that we need an approach that is more encompassing, scalable, and eco-friendly for intelligent algorithm development and implementation. The strategy we present in this paper offers a compelling answer to these issues. We unveil a fresh framework that seamlessly melds high-performance cluster computing with intelligent algorithms, all within a blockchain infrastructure. This promotes both efficiency and a broad-based participation. At its core, our design integrates an evolved proof-of-work consensus process, which links computational efforts directly to rewards for producing blocks. This ensures both optimal resource use and participation from a wide spectrum of computational capacities. Additionally, our approach incorporates a dynamic 'trust rating' that evolves based on a track record of accurate block validations. This rating determines the likelihood of a node being chosen for block generation, creating a merit-based system that recognizes and rewards genuine and precise contributions. To level the playing field further, we suggest a statistical 'draw' system, allowing even less powerful nodes a chance to be part of the block creation process.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21844v1\n    "}}

Given the limitations of traditional signature-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADS) in identifying emerging and zero-day threats, this study investigates the effectiveness of two unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, Isolation Forest (IF) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), using the TON_IoT thermostat dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was performed based on standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) alongside critical resource utilization metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. Experimental results revealed that IF consistently outperformed OC-SVM, achieving higher detection accuracy, superior precision, and recall, along with a significantly better F1-score. Furthermore, Isolation Forest demonstrated a markedly superior computational footprint, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoT edge devices. These findings underscore Isolation Forest's robustness in high-dimensional and imbalanced IoT environments and highlight its practical viability for real-time anomaly detection.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21842v1\n    "}}

These workflows often require transmitting huge amounts of scientific data through wide-area networks. Although high-speed networks like ESnet and transfer services such as Globus have improved data mobility, several challenges remain. The sheer volume of data can overwhelm network bandwidth, widely used transport protocols such as TCP suffer from inefficiencies due to retransmissions triggered by packet loss, and existing fault-tolerance mechanisms like erasure coding introduce substantial overhead.\n  In this paper, we propose JANUS, a resilient and adaptable data transmission approach designed for cross-facility scientific workflows. Unlike traditional TCP-based methods, JANUSleverages UDP, integrates erasure coding for fault tolerance, and combines it with error-bounded lossy compression to reduce overhead. This novel design allows users to balance data transmission time and accuracy, optimizing transfer performance based on specific scientific requirements. Additionally, JANUS dynamically adjusts erasure coding parameters in response to real-time network conditions, ensuring efficient data transfers even in fluctuating environments.

This problem, equivalent to the NP-hard graph coloring problem, directly impacts real-time applications such as autonomous driving and industrial IoT, where minimizing channel estimation time is crucial. This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds. Within Vivado implementation, different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and function inlining are applied to realize the reported speedup. This significant improvement of PK-means GA in execution speed makes it highly suitable for low-latency real-time wireless networks (6G)\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20511v2\n    "}}

Focusing on the two-dimensional case, we show that such systems necessarily exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation and explicitly construct Krylov sectors whose number scales exponentially with system size. While these sectors cannot be distinguished by symmetry quantum numbers, we identify the emergent integrals of motion which characterize them. Our symmetry-based approach is insensitive to details of the Hamiltonian and the lattice, providing a systematic explanation for ergodicity-breaking in a range of systems, including quantum link models.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21815v1\n    "}}

Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges. Our findings identify external unitary control as a universal resource for precision metrology and pave the way for future implementations in quantum sensing.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19631v2\n    "}}

It can be interpreted as a bound on adversary's capability to distinguish two adjacent datasets according to chosen adjacency relation. In practice, most DP implementations use the add/remove adjacency relation, where two datasets are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by adding or removing a single record, thereby protecting membership. In many ML applications, however, the goal is to protect attributes of individual records (e.g., labels used in supervised fine-tuning). We show that privacy accounting under add/remove overstates attribute privacy compared to accounting under the substitute adjacency relation, which permits substituting one record. To demonstrate this gap, we develop novel attacks to audit DP under substitute adjacency, and show empirically that audit results are inconsistent with DP guarantees reported under add/remove, yet remain consistent with the budget accounted under the substitute adjacency relation. Our results highlight that the choice of adjacency when reporting DP guarantees is critical when the protection target is per-record attributes rather than membership.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21804v1\n    "}}

Manipulations such as transmit power inflation, gradual timing drift, and short off grant bursts leave the signaling state intact but distort the expected relationships among the telemetry streams produced by the gNB. This work examines whether these cross layer relationships can serve as a reliable basis for identifying such misbehavior without introducing new signaling. Using a controlled 5G Standalone testbed with commercial user equipment and a software defined radio adversarial device, we study how each manipulation affects the coherence among physical layer measurements, MAC scheduling decisions, and configuration metadata. The results show that every manipulation produces a distinct and reproducible signature that is not visible from any single telemetry source. Power offsets weaken the natural connection between SNR and CQI, timing drift breaks the alignment maintained by the scheduler, and off grant activity produces uplink energy that does not agree with allocation logs. These inconsistencies appear in merged multi layer time series traces and in cross domain views such as the SNR to CQI plane. The findings indicate that cross layer coherence provides a practical signal for detecting uplink misbehavior using only standard gNB telemetry, with no protocol modifications required, which makes the method suitable for integration into operational monitoring and auditing systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21803v1\n    "}}

While tensor network methods like DMRG provide efficient solutions for one-dimensional systems, higher-dimensional problems remain difficult. Here we present a variational double bracket flow (vDBF) algorithm that leverages Sparse Pauli Dynamics, a technique originally developed for classical simulation of quantum circuits, to efficiently approximate ground state energies. By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG. For an 8x8 Hubbard model (128 qubits), the speedup is even more pronounced. These results demonstrate that classical simulation techniques developed in the context of quantum advantage benchmarking can provide practical tools for many-body physics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21651v1\n    "}}

Transparent setup. Our protocol only requires a uniformly random string (URS) setup. The only prior publicly-verifiable NIZK for QMA (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) requires an entire obfuscated program as the common reference string.\n  2. Extractability. Valid QMA witnesses can be extracted directly from our accepting proofs. That is, we obtain a publicly-verifiable non-interactive argument of quantum knowledge, previously only known in a privately-verifiable setting (Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang, CRYPTO 2020).\n  Our construction introduces a novel ZX QMA verifier with \"strong completeness\" and builds upon the coset state authentication scheme from (Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024) within the context of QMA verification. Along the way, we establish new properties of the authentication scheme.\n  The security of our construction rests on the heuristic use of a post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator. Rather than rely on the full-fledged classical oracle model (i.e. ideal obfuscation), we isolate a particular game-based property of the obfuscator that suffices for our proof, which we dub the evasive composability heuristic.\n  As an additional contribution, we study a general method for replacing heuristic use of obfuscation with heuristic use of hash functions in the post-quantum setting. In particular, we establish security of the ideal obfuscation scheme of Jain, Lin, Luo, and Wichs (CRYPTO 2023) in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model (QPrO), which can be heuristically instantiated with a hash function. This gives us NIZK arguments of quantum knowledge for QMA in the QPrO, and additionally allows us to translate several quantum-cryptographic results that were only known in the classical oracle model to results in the QPrO.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05316v3\n    "}}

However, data downloading from EO satellites faces significant challenges due to the limited number of ground stations and the brief communication windows with them. Conversely, emerging LEO constellations like Starlink have enabled continuous connectivity and revolutionized access for ordinary users globally, who can connect via a simple satellite dish. In this paper, we study the feasibility of supporting EO satellites with Starlink satellite infrastructure and introduce a novel data delivery system, designated as \"Starlink Space User\" (SSU), for relaying data from observation satellites. SSU treats EO satellites as space users of Starlink, facilitating efficient data transfer to Earth. At the core of SSU is a novel class of algorithms designed for link and PoP selection, as well as system scheduling optimization, that operate effectively atop Starlink's proprietary infrastructure.

This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21612v1\n    "}}

Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21600v1\n    "}}

It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21598v1\n    "}}

To identify and stop cyber threats, efficient data collection methods are necessary. This research presents an innovative method to cloud security by integrating numerous data sources and modalities with multi-modal deep learning autoencoders. The Multi-Modal Deep Learning Ensemble Architecture (MMDLEA), a unique approach for anomaly detection and classification in multi-modal data, is proposed in this study. The proposed design integrates the best features of six deep learning models: Multi-Modal Deep Learning Autoencoder (MMDLA), Anomaly Detection using Adaptive Metric Learning (ADAM), ADADELTA, ADAGRAD, RMSPROP, and Stacked Graph Transformer (SGT). A final prediction is produced by combining the outputs of all the models, each of which is trained using a distinct modality of the data. Based on the test dataset, the recommended MMDLA architecture achieves an accuracy of 98.5% and an F1-score of 0.985, demonstrating its superior performance over each individual model. Of the different models, the ADAM model performs the best, with an accuracy of 96.2% and an F1-score of 0.962. With an F1-score of 0.955 and an accuracy of 95.5%, the ADADELTA model trails closely behind. MMDLA obtains an F1-score of 0.948 and an accuracy of 94.8%. Additionally, the suggested MMDLEA design exhibits enhanced resilience to fluctuating modalities and noisy data, proving its usefulness in practical settings. Future study in this area is made possible by the results, which show the potential of the proposed framework for abnormal identification and categorization in multi-modal data.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21795v1\n    "}}

This capability has enabled the creation of AI agents that can perform preliminary computations and act through tool calling, now being standardized via protocols like MCP. However, LLMs face fundamental limitations: their context windows cannot grow indefinitely, constraining their memory and computational capacity. Agent collaboration emerges as essential for solving increasingly complex problems, mirroring how computational systems rely on different types of memory to scale. The \"Internet of Agents\" (IoA) represents the communication stack that enables agents to scale by distributing computation across collaborating entities. Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an Agent Communication Layer (L8) and an Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9). L8 formalizes the structure of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the meaning of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a \"Shared Context\" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction. Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19699v2\n    "}}

This work explores whether prethermalization enhances or reduces engine efficiency. We investigate Otto cycles in quantum systems with varying numbers of conserved quantities. We find that additional conservation laws reduce efficiency at positive temperatures, but enhance it in regimes of negative temperatures. Our findings stem from general thermodynamic inequalities for infinitesimal cycles, and we provide evidence for integrable models undergoing finite cycles using the theoretical framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics.

To investigate intrinsic optomechanical nonlinear effects at the single-photon level, it is essential to strengthen the interaction between a single photon and a finite number of phonons. In this work, we enhance the optomechanical coupling by introducing a two-laser driving scheme together with a second-order nonlinear contribution to the cavity resonance frequency, which overtakes the original radiation-pressure nonlinearity as the dominant part in a prototypical Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity. By properly tuning the two driving lasers and the cross-Kerr interaction so that the effective coupling becomes real, we theoretically establish a symmetric optomechanical model at the single-photon level where photon and phonon mode fluctuations exhibit identical dynamics. Within this framework, we analyze the optimal reciprocal transport of the input laser field. Through examination of the optimal signal transmission, we identify the critical boundary associated with the onset of the strong-coupling regime. Additionally, we compare the optical signal scattering behavior in both dissipative equilibrium and nonequilibrium symmetric optomechanical systems, with and without non-rotating-wave contributions. Our work achieves controllable enhancement of the optomechanical coupling and enables optimal signal transfer even in the ultrastrong-coupling regime, suggesting a promising route toward tunable single-photon optomechanical functionalities.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04897v2\n    "}}

Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner.\n  The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high.\n  We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest.\n  We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining.\n  MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21552v1\n    "}}

Radioactive watermarks -- marks that transfer to a model's outputs -- can help detect when such unauthorized data has been used for training. Moreover, aside from being radioactive, an effective watermark for protecting images from unauthorized training also needs to meet other existing requirements, such as imperceptibility, robustness, and multi-bit capacity. To overcome these challenges, we propose HMARK, a novel multi-bit watermarking scheme, which encodes ownership information as secret bits in the semantic-latent space (h-space) for image diffusion models. By leveraging the interpretability and semantic significance of h-space, ensuring that watermark signals correspond to meaningful semantic attributes, the watermarks embedded by HMARK exhibit radioactivity, robustness to distortions, and minimal impact on perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that HMARK achieves 98.57% watermark detection accuracy, 95.07% bit-level recovery accuracy, 100% recall rate, and 1.0 AUC on images produced by the downstream adversarial model finetuned with LoRA on watermarked data across various types of distortions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00094v1\n    "}}

This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21535v1\n    "}}

In this work, we investigate the stability of the superradiant phase in the presence of a weak spin relaxation. We find that even a weak spin relaxation can render the superradiant phase to a superradiant metastable phase, in which symmetry-breaking states are stable only for a finite time. This arises because each spin-jump induced by relaxation applies as a strong perturbation to the system, potentially driving the system from a symmetry-breaking state to the symmetry-preserving saddle point with finite probability, before it eventually relaxes back to a symmetry-breaking state. Such dynamical processes lead to a finite lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states and restore the symmetry in the steady state. To substantiate these results, we combine mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses with exact numerical simulations. The lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states are analyzed in finite-size systems, and the conclusions are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit via finite-size scaling. Our findings establish the metastable nature of the symmetry-breaking states in the dissipative quantum Rabi model and reveal the complexity of the dissipative phase transition beyond their equilibrium counterpart. The mechanisms uncovered here can be generalized to a broad class of open quantum systems, highlighting fundamental distinctions between equilibrium phase transitions and steady-state phase transitions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21508v1\n    "}}

Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attack and defense approaches, and provides a feasible pathway for developing LLMs that can sustainably support responsible AI ecosystems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19218v2\n    "}}

This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems.

In this work, we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and (2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary, including worst-case, levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are tighter than prior methods using $\\varepsilon$-DP, R\u00e9nyi DP, and concentrated DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., an accuracy increase from 52% to 70% in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification, attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06969v3\n    "}}

Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21431v1\n    "}}

Safety is achieved by managing actuation (where electric signals are used to trigger physical movement), dependent on corresponding sensor readings; used as ground truth in decision making. Timely detection of anomalies (attacks, faults and unascertained states) in ICSs is crucial for the safe running of a plant, the safety of its personnel, and for the safe provision of any services provided. We propose an anomaly detection method that involves accurate linearization of the non-linear forms arising from sensor-actuator(s) relationships, primarily because solving linear models is easier and well understood. We accomplish this by using a well-known water treatment testbed as a use case. Our experiments show millisecond time response to detect anomalies, all of which are explainable and traceable; this simultaneous coupling of detection speed and explainability has not been achieved by other state of the art Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML) models with eXplainable AI (XAI) used for the same purpose. Our methods explainability enables us to pin-point the sensor(s) and the actuation state(s) for which the anomaly was detected. The proposed algorithm showed an accuracy of 97.72% by flagging deviations within safe operation limits as non-anomalous; indicative that slower detectors with highest detection resolution is unnecessary, for systems whose safety boundaries provide leeway within safety limits.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20906v3\n    "}}

In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506v2\n    "}}

Uniswap V2, a leading DEX, facilitates the rapid creation and trading of new tokens, which offer high return potential but exposing investors to significant risks. In this work, we analyze the financial impact of newly created tokens, assessing their market dynamics, profitability and liquidity manipulations. Our findings reveal that a significant portion of market liquidity is trapped in honeypots, reducing market efficiency and misleading investors. Applying a simple buy-and-hold strategy, we are able to uncover some major risks associated with investing in newly created tokens, including the widespread presence of rug pulls and sandwich attacks. We extract the optimal sandwich amount, revealing that their proliferation in new tokens stems from higher profitability in low-liquidity pools. Furthermore, we analyze the fundamental differences between token price evolution in swap time and physical time. Using clustering techniques, we highlight these differences and identify typical patterns of honeypot and sellable tokens. Our study provides insights into the risks and financial dynamics of decentralized markets and their challenges for investors.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10512v2\n    "}}

For finite Galois field extensions the objects are their Galois groups and their invariants.\n  In \\cite{GaloisTh-RingThAp}, we introduce a new (ring theoretic) approach to the Galois Theory which is based on\n  the {\\em principle of maximal symmetry}. In \\cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}, the maximal symmetry of {\\em normal} finite field extensions yields an analogue of the Galois Theory for them. For a normal finite field extension $L/K$ the `natural/obvious' objects are the subalgebra $\\CD (L/K)\\rtimes G(L/K)$ of $\\End (L/K)$ that is generated by the automorphism group $G(L/K)$ and the algebra $\\CD (L/K)$ of differential operators on $L/K$ and its `invariants'.

In this evolving landscape, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional Internet Protocol (IP)-based architectures. CCN offers advantages such as in-network caching, scalability, and efficient content dissemination, all of which are particularly well-suited to the constraints of the IoT. However, deploying content-centric approaches in 5G-based IoT environments introduces significant security challenges. Key concerns include content authentication, data integrity, privacy protection, and resilience against attacks such as spoofing and cache poisoning. Such issues are exacerbated by the distributed, mobile, and heterogeneous nature of IoT and 5G systems. In this survey, we review and classify existing security solutions for content-centric architectures in IoT-5G scenarios. We highlight current trends, identify limitations in existing approaches, and outline future research directions with a focus on lightweight and adaptive security mechanisms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21336v1\n    "}}

In my Ph.D. I showed that Schanuel Conjecture has a geometrical origin: it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\u00e9 periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive without abelian part.\n  In this paper, we state a conjecture in Schanuel style, which will imply conjectures in Lindemann-Weierstrass style, for the semi-elliptic exponential function, that is for the exponential map of an extension G of an elliptic curve E by a multiplicative group. We propose the semi-elliptic Conjecture, which concerns the exponential function, the Weierstrass $\\wp,$ $\u03b6$ functions and Serre functions. The case of a trivial extension has been treated in \\cite{BW}, where we introduced the split semi-elliptic Conjecture.\n  As in Schanuel's case, we expect that the semi-elliptic Conjecture contains all ``reasonable\" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function, of the Weierstrass $\\wp$, $\u03b6$ functions and of Serre functions.\n  We show that the semi-elliptic Conjecture has a geometrical origin (as Schanuel Conjecture): it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\u00e9 periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive whose underlying abelian part is an elliptic curve.\n  We prove the Grothendieck-Andr\u00e9 periods Conjecture for 1-motives defined by an elliptic curve with algebraic invariants and complex multiplication and by torsion points.\n  We introduce the $\u03c3$-Conjecture which involves the Weierstrass $\\wp$, $\u03b6$ and $\u03c3$ functions and we show that this conjecture is a consequence of the Grothendieck-Andr\u00e9 periods Conjecture applied to an adequate 1-motive.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08700v2\n    "}}

We introduce a general Hamiltonian framework for simulating full interacting QFTs, using a spatial lattice of continuos-variable ``qumodes'' -- bosonic local oscillators whose high-dimensional local Hilbert space faithfully captures interacting field dynamics. This construction is rooted in continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), and provides a unified platform spanning efficient classical tensor-network methods and emerging photonic quantum hardware. The first key advance of this work is a robust and scaleable method for preparing the QFT in its correct initial vacuum state. We develop an imaginary-time preparation algorithm tailored to qumode lattices, that efficiently projects onto the vacuum even in strongly coupled regimes. This provides a controllable starting point for studying nonperturbative dynamics such as tunnelling and real-time decay. Building on this, we use a time-evolving block decimation algorithm to capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. Our second key advance is the identification and excitation of the negative fluctuation mode of the bounce configuration on the qumode lattice. A small displacement along this mode produces the expected tachyonic growth, driving fully coherent bubble nucleation without requiring classically supercritical seeds. This demonstrates that the qumode lattice captures non-perturbative quantum dynamics that lie beyond the classical treatments. Our results establish the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and pave the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388v2\n    "}}

Obfuscation involves techniques that deliberately modify software to make it more challenging to understand and reverse-engineer, while maintaining its original functionality. Although obfuscation is widely adopted, its effectiveness remains largely unexplored and unthoroughly evaluated. This paper presents a controlled experiment involving Master's students performing code comprehension tasks on applications hardened with obfuscation. The experiment's goals are to assess the effectiveness of obfuscation in delaying code comprehension by attackers and to determine whether complexity metrics can accurately predict the impact of these protections on success rates and durations of code comprehension tasks. The study is the first to evaluate the effect of layering multiple obfuscation techniques on a single piece of protected code. It also provides experimental evidence of the correlation between objective metrics of the attacked code and the likelihood of a successful attack, bridging the gap between objective and subjective approaches to estimating potency. Finally, the paper highlights significant aspects that warrant additional analysis and opens new avenues for further experiments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21301v1\n    "}}

While machine unlearning techniques can remove backdoor behaviors, current methods lack transparency and real-time interpretability. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) into the unlearning process to provide real-time monitoring and explainability. We propose the Trigger Attention Ratio (TAR) metric to quantitatively measure the model's attention shift from trigger patterns to legitimate object features. Our balanced unlearning strategy combines gradient ascent on backdoor samples, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for catastrophic forgetting prevention, and a recovery phase for clean accuracy restoration.

LatencyScope models latency sources at every layer of the Radio Access Network (RAN), pinpointing system-level bottlenecks--such as radio interfaces, scheduling policies, and hardware/software constraints--while capturing their intricate dependencies and their stochastic nature. LatencyScope also includes a configuration optimizer that uses its mathematical models to search through hundreds of billions of configurations and find settings that meet latency-reliability targets under user constraints. We validate LatencyScope on two open-sourced 5G RAN testbeds (srsRAN and OAI), demonstrating that it can closely match empirical latency distributions and significantly outperform prior analytical models and widely used simulators (MATLAB 5G Toolbox, 5G-LENA).

Among various NNW approaches, weight-based methods are favored for their simplicity and practicality; however, they remain vulnerable to forging and overwriting attacks. To address those challenges, we propose NeuralMark, a robust method built around a hashed watermark filter. Specifically, we utilize a hash function to generate an irreversible binary watermark from a secret key, which is then used as a filter to select the model parameters for embedding. This design cleverly intertwines the embedding parameters with the hashed watermark, providing a robust defense against both forging and overwriting attacks. An average pooling is also incorporated to resist fine-tuning and pruning attacks. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into various neural network architectures, ensuring broad applicability. Theoretically, we analyze its security boundary. Empirically, we verify its effectiveness and robustness across 13 distinct Convolutional and Transformer architectures, covering five image classification tasks and one text generation task.

The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $\u03a9/\u039b$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14701v2\n    "}}

In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfiltration attack based on image compression techniques.\n  This attack, termed Data Exfiltration by Compression, requires only access to a data lake and is based on lossless or lossy image compression methods. Unlike previous data exfiltration attacks, it is compatible with any image processing task and depends solely on an exported network model without requiring any additional information to be collected during the training process. We explore various scenarios, and techniques to limit the size of the exported model and conceal the compression codes within the network.\n  Using two public datasets of CT and MR images, we demonstrate that this attack can effectively steal medical images and reconstruct them outside the data lake with high fidelity, achieving an optimal balance between compression and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we investigate the impact of basic differential privacy measures, such as adding Gaussian noise to the model parameters, to prevent the Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack. We also show how the attacker can make their attack resilient to differential privacy at the expense of decreasing the number of stolen images. Lastly, we propose an alternative prevention strategy by fine-tuning the model to be exported.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21227v1\n    "}}

Existing watermarking techniques either target base models or verify LoRA modules themselves, yet they fail to propagate watermarks to generated images, leaving a critical gap in traceability. Moreover, traceability watermarking designed for base models is not tightly coupled with stylization and often introduces visual degradation or high false-positive detection rates. To address these limitations, we propose AuthenLoRA, a unified watermarking framework that embeds imperceptible, traceable watermarks directly into the LoRA training process while preserving stylization quality. AuthenLoRA employs a dual-objective optimization strategy that jointly learns the target style distribution and the watermark-induced distribution shift, ensuring that any image generated with the watermarked LoRA reliably carries the watermark. We further design an expanded LoRA architecture for enhanced multi-scale adaptation and introduce a zero-message regularization mechanism that substantially reduces false positives during watermark verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AuthenLoRA achieves high-fidelity stylization, robust watermark propagation, and significantly lower false-positive rates compared with existing approaches.

This uncertainty stems from a critical disconnect in prior research: studies often overlook the inherent nature of malware and are fragmented, examining diverse variables like realism or confidence of adversarial examples in isolation, or relying on weak evaluations that yield non-generalizable insights. To address this, we introduce Rubik, a framework for the systematic, multi-dimensional evaluation of AT in the malware domain. This framework defines diverse key factors across essential dimensions, including data, feature representations, classifiers, and robust optimization settings, for a comprehensive exploration of the interplay of influential AT's variables through reliable evaluation practices, such as realistic evasion attacks. We instantiate Rubik on Android malware, empirically analyzing how this interplay shapes robustness. Our findings challenge prior beliefs--showing, for instance, that realizable adversarial examples offer only conditional robustness benefits--and reveal new insights, such as the critical role of model architecture and feature-space structure in determining AT's success. From this analysis, we distill four key insights, expose four common evaluation misconceptions, and offer practical recommendations to guide the development of truly robust malware classifiers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18218v2\n    "}}

Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21181v1\n    "}}

Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21180v1\n    "}}

To address these threats to data confidentiality, this paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-driven secure access strategy. The strategy leverages a virtual replica of the physical SAGIN environment within the DT framework to continuously assess dynamic eavesdropping risks by quantifying secrecy capacity. Operating within this DT framework, an evolutionary game model dynamically balances the DT-updated secrecy capacity against queuing delay, steering IoT devices toward more secure and efficient access decisions. Furthermore, a novel distributed algorithm, integral to the DT operation, is developed to obtain the equilibrium access strategy for each device in a scalable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-based approach substantially improves the security of SAGIN-enabled IoT networks. Additionally, it effectively balances system load, prevents overload occurrences, and decreases queuing delay compared to benchmark schemes, thereby comprehensively improving overall network performance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21156v1\n    "}}

Among these attacks, finetuning-based ones that compromise LLMs' safety alignment via fine-tuning stand out due to its stable jailbreak performance. In particular, a recent study indicates that fine-tuning with as few as 10 harmful question-answer (QA) pairs can lead to successful jailbreaking across various harmful questions. However, such malicious fine-tuning attacks are readily detectable and hence thwarted by moderation models. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can be jailbroken by fine-tuning with only 10 benign QA pairs; our attack exploits the increased sensitivity of LLMs to fine-tuning data after being overfitted. Specifically, our fine-tuning process starts with overfitting an LLM via fine-tuning with benign QA pairs involving identical refusal answers. Further fine-tuning is then performed with standard benign answers, causing the overfitted LLM to forget the refusal attitude and thus provide compliant answers regardless of the harmfulness of a question. We implement our attack on the ten LLMs and compare it with five existing baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in both attack effectiveness and attack stealth. Our findings expose previously unreported security vulnerabilities in current LLMs and provide a new perspective on understanding how LLMs' security is compromised, even with benign fine-tuning.

Diffusion Large Language Model May Demand a Distinct Position\n    summary: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive non-autoregressive paradigm due to their unique training and inference approach. However, there is currently a lack of safety study on this novel architecture. In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs' safety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to their unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical asymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the defender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the initial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this seems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the defender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate middle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential generation order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and diverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this asymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method that directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals exploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security performance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the utility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning. The results strongly prove the superiority of MOSA.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12398v2\n    "}}

By running the LLM on local or edge devices ,we eliminate the need for external APIs, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure and is not transmitted over the internet. Although lightweight models may not match the performance of more complex models like GPT-4, we enhance their efficiency and accuracy through RAG. RAG retrieves relevant information from a comprehensive database, enabling the LLM to generate more precise and effective network configurations based on natural language user input. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the generated configurations but also simplifies the process of creating and configuring private networks, making it accessible to users without extensive networking or programming experience. The objective of this demonstration is to highlight the potential of combining local LLMs and RAG to deliver secure, efficient, and adaptable 5G network solutions, paving the way for a future where 5G networks are both privacy-conscious and versatile across diverse user profiles.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21084v1\n    "}}

Current researches on privacy assessment for LVLMs is limited in scope, with gaps in both assessment dimensions and privacy categories. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-PA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the privacy preservation capabilities of LVLMs in terms of privacy awareness and leakage. Privacy awareness measures the model's ability to recognize the privacy sensitivity of input data, while privacy leakage assesses the risk of the model unintentionally disclosing privacy information in its output. We design a range of sub-tasks to thoroughly evaluate the model's privacy protection offered by LVLMs. Multi-PA covers 26 categories of personal privacy, 15 categories of trade secrets, and 18 categories of state secrets, totaling 31,962 samples. Based on Multi-PA, we evaluate the privacy preservation capabilities of 21 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs. Our results reveal that current LVLMs generally pose a high risk of facilitating privacy breaches, with vulnerabilities varying across personal privacy, trade secret, and state secret.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19496v3\n    "}}

Our work targets last-level cache (LLC) based architectures, including GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs) and AI accelerators. We introduce LLaMCAT, a novel approach to optimize the LLC for LLM inference. LLaMCAT combines Miss Status Holding Register (MSHR)- and load balance-aware cache arbitration with thread throttling to address stringent bandwidth demands and minimize cache stalls in KV Cache access. We also propose a hybrid simulation framework integrating analytical models with cycle-level simulators via memory traces, balancing architecture detail and efficiency.\n  Experiments demonstrate that LLaMCAT achieves an average speedup of 1.26x when the system is mainly bottlenecked by miss handling throughput, while baselines mostly show negative improvements since they are not optimized for this scenario. When the cache size is also limited, our policy achieves a speedup of 1.58x over the unoptimized version, and a 1.26x improvement over the best baseline (dyncta). Overall, LLaMCAT is the first to target LLM decoding-specific MSHR contention, a gap in previous work. It presents a practical solution for accelerating LLM inference on future hardware platforms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00083v1\n    "}}

Since users' sensitivity to location data varies based on factors such as stay duration, access frequency, and semantic sensitivity, implementing personalized privacy protection is imperative. This paper proposes a Personalized Trajectory Privacy Protection Mechanism (PTPPM) to address these challenges. Our approach begins by modeling an attacker's knowledge of a user's trajectory spatiotemporal correlations, which enables the attacker to identify possible location sets and disregard low-probability location sets. To combat this, we integrate geo-indistinguishability with distortion privacy, allowing users to customize their privacy preferences through a configurable privacy budget and expected inference error bound. This approach provides the theoretical framework for constructing a Protection Location Set (PLS) that obscures users' actual locations. Additionally, we introduce a Personalized Privacy Budget Allocation Algorithm (PPBA), which assesses the sensitivity of locations based on trajectory data and allocates privacy budgets accordingly. This algorithm considers factors such as location semantics and road network constraints. Furthermore, we propose a Permute-and-Flip mechanism that generates perturbed locations while minimizing perturbation distance, thus balancing privacy protection and Quality of Service (QoS). Simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms existing benchmarks, offering superior privacy protection while maintaining user QoS requirements.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21020v1\n    "}}

User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them.\n  State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux.\n  This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.\n  Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21018v1\n    "}}

The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality.\n  First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically.\n  Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19258v2\n    "}}

However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20994v1\n    "}}

In general, existing jailbreak techniques either optimize a semantic template intended to induce the LLM to produce harmful outputs or optimize a suffix that leads the LLM to initiate its response with specific tokens (e.g., \"Sure\").\n  In this work, we introduce TASO (Template and Suffix Optimization), a novel jailbreak method that optimizes both a template and a suffix in an alternating manner. Our insight is that suffix optimization and template optimization are complementary to each other: suffix optimization can effectively control the first few output tokens but cannot control the overall quality of the output, while template optimization provides guidance for the entire output but cannot effectively control the initial tokens, which significantly impact subsequent responses. Thus, they can be combined to improve the attack's effectiveness.\n  We evaluate the effectiveness of TASO on benchmark datasets (including HarmBench and AdvBench) on 24 leading LLMs (including models from the Llama family, OpenAI, and DeepSeek). The results demonstrate that TASO can effectively jailbreak existing LLMs. We hope our work can inspire future studies in exploring this direction.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18581v2\n    "}}

As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20983v1\n    "}}

Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20975v1\n    "}}

This heterogeneity, combined with the quadratic complexity of attention, creates severe convoy effects where long-running requests stall short, interactive ones, degrading system responsiveness. We present Medha, a serving system that eliminates these convoys by introducing fine-grained, preemptive scheduling to LLM inference.\n  Medha makes preemption practical with a co-designed set of mechanisms -- including Adaptive Chunking and Stream Pipeline Parallel that overcome the perceived inefficiencies and scaling challenges of chunking. Additionally, we present a new parallelism strategy KV-Cache Parallelism to reduce the decode latency and afford interactivity despite very long context. These mechanisms are orchestrated by a Length-Aware Relative Slack (LARS) scheduler, a deadline and heterogeneity-aware scheduling policy that prevents both the convoy effect and the starvation that plagues simpler policies. Under a heterogeneous workload, Medha improves throughput by 5.7x while reducing median and 99th percentile latency by 30x and 174x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art non-preemptive systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17264v5\n    "}}

One of the main applications of 5G is the real-time distribution of Ultra High-Definition (UHD) content with a resolution of 4K or 8K. In Q2/2021, Advanced Info Service (AIS), the biggest operator in Thailand, launched 5G SA, providing both 5G SA/NSA service nationwide in addition to the existing LTE network. While many parts of the world are still in process of rolling out the first phase of 5G in Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, 5G SA in Thailand already covers more than 76% of the population.\n  In this paper, UHD video will be a real-time live streaming via MPEG-DASH over different mobile network technologies with minimal buffer size to provide the lowest latency. Then, performance such as the number of dropped segments, MAC throughput, and latency are evaluated in various situations such as stationary, moving in the urban area, moving at high speed, and also an ideal condition with maximum SINR. It has been found that 5G SA can deliver more than 95% of the UHD video segment successfully within the required time window in all situations, while 5G NSA produced mixed results depending on the condition of the LTE network. The result also reveals that the LTE network failed to deliver more than 20% of the video segment within the deadline, which shows that 5G SA is absolutely necessary for low-latency UHD video streaming and 5G NSA may not be good enough for such task as it relies on the legacy control signal.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20961v1\n    "}}

This doubles the theoretical throughput compared to rank 2 MIMO and also improves reception performance. However, 4x4 MIMO support on low-band frequencies (<1 GHz) is absent in every commercial UEs, with the exception of the Xperia 1 flagship smartphones manufactured by Sony Mobile and the Xiaomi 14 Pro as of January 2024. The reason most manufacturers omit 4x4 MIMO support for low-band frequencies is likely due to design challenges or relatively small performance gains in real-world usage due to the lack of 4T4R deployment on low-band by mobile network operators around the world.\n  In Thailand, 4T4R deployment on the b28/n28 (APT) band is common on True-H and dtac networks, enabling 4x4 MIMO transmission on supported UEs. In this paper, the real-world 4x4 MIMO performance on the b28/n28 (APT) band will be investigated by evaluating the reliability test under different signal conditions and the maximum throughput test by evaluating the performance under optimal conditions, using the Sony Xperia 1 III and the Sony Xperia 1 IV smartphone. Devices from other manufacturers are also used in the experiment to investigate the performance with 2Rx antennas for comparison. Through firmware modifications, the Sony Xperia 1 III and IV can be configured to use only 2 Rx ports on low-band, enabling the collection of comparative 2 Rx performance data as a reference.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20959v1\n    "}}

This progress creates urgency for the development of compilation workflows that directly target the forthcoming generation of devices with thousands of physical qubits, for which algorithm execution becomes practical. We develop a pipeline for compiling logical algorithms to physical circuits implementing lattice surgery on the surface code, and use this pipeline to identify the requirements for achieving algorithmic break-even -- where quantum error correction improves the performance of a quantum algorithm -- for two prominent quantum algorithms: the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our pipeline integrates several open-source software tools, and leverages recent advances in error-aware unitary gate synthesis, high-fidelity magic state production, and the calculation of correlation surfaces in the surface code. We perform classical simulations of physical Clifford proxy circuits produced by our pipeline, and find that both 5-qubit QAOA and QPE can reach algorithmic break-even with 2517 physical qubits (surface code distance $d=11$) at physical error rates of $p=10^{-3}$, or 1737 physical qubits ($d=9$) at $p=5\\times 10^{-4}$. Our work thereby identifies conditions for achieving algorithmic break-even with near-term quantum hardware and paves the way towards an end-to-end compiler for early-fault-tolerant surface code architectures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20947v1\n    "}}

We evaluate seven prominent open-source models ranging from 3.8B to 32B parameters on 4,000+ attack attempts.

As MCP adoption grows across community servers and major platforms, organizations encounter threats that existing AI governance frameworks (such as NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001) do not yet cover in detail. We focus on three types of adversaries that take advantage of MCP s flexibility: content-injection attackers that embed malicious instructions into otherwise legitimate data; supply-chain attackers who distribute compromised servers; and agents who become unintentional adversaries by over-stepping their role. Based on early incidents and proof-of-concept attacks, we describe how MCP can increase the attack surface through data-driven exfiltration, tool poisoning, and cross-system privilege escalation. In response, we propose a set of practical controls, including per-user authentication with scoped authorization, provenance tracking across agent workflows, containerized sandboxing with input/output checks, inline policy enforcement with DLP and anomaly detection, and centralized governance using private registries or gateway layers. The aim is to help organizations ensure that unvetted code does not run outside a sandbox, tools are not used beyond their intended scope, data exfiltration attempts are detectable, and actions can be audited end-to-end. We close by outlining open research questions around verifiable registries, formal methods for these dynamic systems, and privacy-preserving agent operations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20920v1\n    "}}

A TDC encodes messages in such a manner that tampering the codeword causes the decoder to either output the original message, or reject it. In this work, we study quantum analogs of one of the most well-studied adversarial tampering models: the so-called $t$-split-state tampering model, where the codeword is divided into $t$ shares, and each share is tampered with \"locally\".\n  It is impossible to achieve tamper detection in the split-state model using classical codewords. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the situation changes significantly if the message can be encoded into a multipartite quantum state, entangled across the $t$ shares. Concretely, we define a family of quantum TDCs defined on any $t\\geq 3$ shares, which can detect arbitrary split-state tampering so long as the adversaries are unentangled, or even limited to a finite amount of pre-shared entanglement. Previously, this was only known in the limit of asymptotically large $t$.\n  As our flagship application, we show how to augment threshold secret sharing schemes with similar tamper-detecting guarantees. We complement our results by establishing connections between quantum TDCs and quantum encryption schemes.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16009v2\n    "}}

Most works trained one model to handle the end-to-end patching pipeline (including issue localization, patch generation, and patch validation). However, it is hard for a small model to handle all tasks, as different sub-tasks have different workflows and require different expertise. As such, by using a 70 billion model, SOTA methods can only reach up to 41% resolved rate on SWE-bench-Verified. Motivated by the collaborative nature, we propose Co-PatcheR, the first collaborative patching system with small and specialized reasoning models for individual components. Our key technique novelties are the specific task designs and training recipes. First, we train a model for localization and patch generation. Our localization pinpoints the suspicious lines through a two-step procedure, and our generation combines patch generation and critique. We then propose a hybrid patch validation that includes two models for crafting issue-reproducing test cases with and without assertions and judging patch correctness, followed by a majority vote-based patch selection. Through extensive evaluation, we show that Co-PatcheR achieves 46% resolved rate on SWE-bench-Verified with only 3 x 14B models. This makes Co-PatcheR the best patcher with specialized models, requiring the least training resources and the smallest models. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study to validate our recipes, as well as our choice of training data number, model size, and testing-phase scaling strategy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18955v2\n    "}}

While the datasets play an important role, their protection has remained as an unsolved issue. Current protection strategies, such as watermarks and membership inference, are either in high poison rate which is detrimental to image quality or suffer from low accuracy and robustness. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, EnTruth, which Enhances Traceability of unauthorized dataset usage utilizing template memorization. By strategically incorporating the template memorization, EnTruth can trigger the specific behavior in unauthorized models as the evidence of infringement. Our method is the first to investigate the positive application of memorization and use it for copyright protection, which turns a curse into a blessing and offers a pioneering perspective for unauthorized usage detection in generative models.

However, LLMs' effectiveness for phishing detection remains unexplored. This study investigates how to effectively leverage LLMs for phishing detection (including target brand identification) by examining the impact of input modalities (screenshots, logos, HTML, and URLs), temperature settings, and prompt engineering strategies. Using a dataset of 19,131 real-world phishing websites and 243 benign sites, we evaluate seven LLMs -- two commercial models (GPT 4.1 and Gemini 2.0 flash) and five open-source models (Qwen, Llama, Janus, DeepSeek-VL2, and R1) -- alongside two deep learning (DL)-based baselines (PhishIntention and Phishpedia).\n  Our findings reveal that commercial LLMs generally outperform open-source models in phishing detection, while DL models demonstrate better performance on benign samples. For brand identification, screenshot inputs achieve optimal results, with commercial LLMs reaching 93-95% accuracy and open-source models, particularly Qwen, achieving up to 92%. However, incorporating multiple input modalities simultaneously or applying one-shot prompts does not consistently enhance performance and may degrade results. Furthermore, higher temperature values reduce performance. Based on these results, we recommend using screenshot inputs with zero temperature to maximize accuracy for LLM-based detectors with HTML serving as auxiliary context when screenshot information is insufficient.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09606v2\n    "}}

However, this shift also introduces security risks, as LLMs may generate insecure code that can be exploited by adversaries. Current educational approaches emphasize efficiency while overlooking these risks, leaving students underprepared to identify and mitigate security issues in AI-assisted workflows.\n  To address this gap, we present Bifr\u00f6st, an educational framework that cultivates security awareness in AI-augmented development. Bifr\u00f6st integrates (1) a Visual Studio Code extension simulating realistic environments, (2) adversarially configured LLMs that generate insecure code, and (3) a feedback system highlighting vulnerabilities. By immersing students in tasks with compromised LLMs and providing targeted security analysis, Bifr\u00f6st cultivates critical evaluation skills; classroom deployments (n=61) show vulnerability to insecure code, while a post-intervention survey (n=21) indicates increased skepticism toward LLM outputs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20878v1\n    "}}

While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization that employs a novel contrastive RL algorithm.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves significant performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on A100, it delivers an average speedup of x3.12 with a median speedup of x1.42 against default baselines over across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x120. In addition to the default baseline provided by KernelBench, CUDA-L1 demonstrates x2.77 over Torch Compile, x2.88 over Torch Compile with reduce overhead, x2.81 over CUDA Graph implementations, and remarkably x7.72 over cuDNN libraries. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates portability across different GPU architectures.\n  Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several properties: it 1) discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization, such as the multiplicative nature of optimizations; 3) identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that actually harm performance. The capabilities demonstrate that, RL can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14111v9\n    "}}

Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13632v2\n    "}}

However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20860v1\n    "}}

However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, achieving high accuracy with energy errors equivalent to an effective temperature of 0.2 (in units of the Kitaev interactions), consistent with the experimentally relevant spin-liquid regime. Starting from these states, we apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a non-zero Chern number, a hallmark of topological order, which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08939v2\n    "}}

SpC builds a kernel map that stores mappings between input voxel coordinates, output coordinates, and weight offsets, then uses this map to compute feature vectors for output coordinates. Our work identifies three key properties of voxel coordinates: they are integer-valued, bounded within a limited spatial range, and geometrically continuous-neighboring voxels on the same object surface are highly likely to exist at small spatial offsets from each other. Prior SpC engines do not fully exploit these properties and suffer from high pre-processing and post-processing overheads during kernel map construction. To address this, we design Spira, the first voxel-property-aware SpC engine for GPUs. Spira proposes: (i) a high-performance one-shot search algorithm that builds the kernel map with no preprocessing and high memory locality, (ii) an effective packed-native processing scheme that accesses packed voxel coordinates at low cost, (iii) a flexible dual-dataflow execution mechanism that efficiently computes output feature vectors by adapting to layer characteristics, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy that builds kernel maps for all SpC layers concurrently at network start. Our evaluation shows that Spira significantly outperforms prior SpC engines by 1.71x on average and up to 2.31x for end-to-end inference, and by 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x for layer-wise execution across diverse layer configurations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20834v1\n    "}}

The accuracy improvement of data imputation extends to private data analyses across distributed databases. However, existing data imputation methods violate the privacy of the data rendering the privacy protection in the downstream analyses obsolete. We conclude that private data analysis requires private data imputation.\n  In this paper, we present the first optimized protocols for private data imputation. We consider the case of horizontally and vertically split data sets. Our optimization aims to reduce most of the computation to private set intersection (or at least oblivious programmable pseudo-random function) protocols which can be very efficiently computed. We show that private data imputation has -- on average across all evaluated datasets -- an accuracy advantage of 20\\% in case of vertically split data and 5\\% in case of horizontally split data over imputing data locally. In case of the worst data split we observed that imputing using our method resulted in an increase of up to 32.7 times in the quality of imputation over the vertically split data and 3.4 times in case of horizontally split data. Our protocols are very efficient and run in 2.4 seconds in case of vertically split data and 8.4 seconds in case of horizontally split data for 100,000 records evaluated in the 10 Gbps network setting, performing one data imputation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20832v1\n    "}}

Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \\textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains.

While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20799v1\n    "}}

This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the availability of a file server (Nextcloud) hosted in a private cloud environment using Apache CloudStack. The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems. Four architectural configurations were modeled, including the baseline, host-level redundancy, virtual machine (VM) redundancy, and a combination of both.

As a result, a wider array of privacy interests is implicated for users of electronic communications networks and services. This development calls into question the scope of electronic communications privacy rules. This paper analyses the scope of these rules, taking into account the rationale and the historic background of the European electronic communications privacy framework. We develop a framework for analysing the scope of electronic communications privacy rules using three approaches: (i) a service-centric approach, (ii) a data-centric approach, and (iii) a value-centric approach. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The current e-Privacy Directive contains a complex blend of the three approaches, which does not seem to be based on a thorough analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. The upcoming review of the directive announced by the European Commission provides an opportunity to improve the scoping of the rules.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20744v1\n    "}}

Our scheme uses lattice-based cryptography and, in particular, achieves quantum-resistance by leveraging the hardness of the inhomogeneous short integer solution (ISIS) problem. In contrast to prior work, which assumes that the reader-server communication channel is secure, our scheme is secure even when both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels are insecure. Our proposed protocol provides robust security against man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, impersonation, and reflection attacks, while also ensuring unforgeability and preserving anonymity. We present a detailed security analysis, including semi-formal analysis and formal verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. In addition, we analyze the storage, computation, and communication costs of the proposed protocol and compare its security properties with those of existing protocols, demonstrating that our scheme offers strong security guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first quantum-resistant authentication protocol for RFID systems that comprehensively addresses the insecurity of both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20630v1\n    "}}

Yet, the challenge of transforming these idealized security models into practical, resilient systems remains a pressing issue, especially as quantum computing evolves. In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature. To bring everything together, the relevance of this review concerning quantum augmented networks (QuANets) is also presented. This allows the readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security promises of quantum key distribution from theoretical proofs to experimental validations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20602v1\n    "}}

Our benchmark goes beyond prior work by emphasizing injections that can influence real-world actions rather than mere text outputs, and by presenting attack payloads with complexity and distractor frequency similar to what real-world agents encounter. We leverage this benchmark to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing defenses, assessing their effectiveness across a suite of frontier AI models. We propose a multi-layered defense strategy comprising both architectural and model-based defenses to protect against evolving prompt injection attacks. Our work offers a blueprint for designing practical, secure web agents through a defense-in-depth approach.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20597v1\n    "}}

Nevertheless, the security and robustness of QML systems remain underexplored, especially under adversarial conditions. In this paper, we present a systematization of adversarial robustness in QML, integrating conceptual organization with empirical evaluation across three threat models-black-box, gray-box, and white-box. We implement representative attacks in each category, including label-flipping for black-box, QUID encoder-level data poisoning for gray-box, and FGSM and PGD for white-box, using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) trained on two datasets from distinct domains: MNIST from computer vision and AZ-Class from Android malware, across multiple circuit depths (2, 5, 10, and 50 layers) and two encoding schemes (angle and amplitude). Our evaluation shows that amplitude encoding yields the highest clean accuracy (93% on MNIST and 67% on AZ-Class) in deep, noiseless circuits; however, it degrades sharply under adversarial perturbations and depolarization noise (p=0.01), dropping accuracy below 5%. In contrast, angle encoding, while offering lower representational capacity, remains more stable in shallow, noisy regimes, revealing a trade-off between capacity and robustness. Moreover, the QUID attack attains higher attack success rates, though quantum noise channels disrupt the Hilbert-space correlations it exploits, weakening its impact in image domains. This suggests that noise can act as a natural defense mechanism in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. Overall, our findings guide the development of secure and resilient QML architectures for practical deployment. These insights underscore the importance of designing threat-aware models that remain reliable under real-world noise in NISQ settings.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14989v2\n    "}}

Prior works of CLI fuzzing face the challenges of generating semantics-rich option strings and input files, which cannot reach deeply embedded target functions. This often leads to a misdetection of such a deep vulnerability using existing CLI fuzzing techniques. In this paper, we design a novel Path-guided, Iterative LLM-Orchestrated Testing framework, called PILOT, to fuzz CLI applications. The key insight is to provide potential call paths to target functions as context to LLM so that it can better generate CLI option strings and input files. Then, PILOT iteratively repeats the process, and provides reached functions as additional context so that target functions are reached. Our evaluation on real-world CLI applications demonstrates that PILOT achieves higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches and discovers 51 zero-day vulnerabilities. We responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities to their developers and so far 41 have been confirmed by their developers with 33 being fixed and three assigned CVE identifiers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20555v1\n    "}}

In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking.

Stabilizer codes, including surface code and color code, have long been the focus of research and have seen significant experimental progress in recent years. Recently proposed time-dynamical QEC, including Floquet codes and generalized time-dynamical code implementations, opens up new opportunities for FT quantum computation. By employing a periodic schedule of low-weight parity checks, Floquet codes can generate additional dynamical logical qubits, offering enhanced error correction capabilities and potentially higher code performance. Here, we experimentally implement the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code on a superconducting quantum processor. We encode a dynamical logical qubit within a $3\\times 3$ lattice of data qubits, alongside a conventional static logical qubit. We demonstrate FT encoding and measurement of the two-qubit logical states, and stabilize these states using repeated error detection. We showcase universal single-qubit logical gates on the dynamical qubit. Furthermore, by implementing a logical CNOT gate, we entangle the dynamical and static logical qubits, generating an error-detected logical Bell state with a fidelity of 75.9\\%. Our results highlight the potential of Floquet codes for resource-efficient FT quantum computation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03867v4\n    "}}

We address both constraints simultaneously with, to our knowledge, the first-ever isogeny framework that encodes super-singular elliptic-curve isogeny data via novel Engel expansions over the p-adic Laurent series.

To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05865v2\n    "}}

Here, we present a novel integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and zero trust architecture (ZTA), formally grounded in category theory, to secure AI model access. Our framework uniquely models cryptographic workflows as morphisms and trust policies as functors, enabling fine-grained, adaptive trust and micro-segmentation for lattice-based PQC primitives. This approach offers enhanced protection against adversarial AI threats. We demonstrate its efficacy through a concrete ESP32-based implementation, validating a crypto-agile transition with quantifiable performance and security improvements, underpinned by categorical proofs for AI security. The implementation achieves significant memory efficiency on ESP32, with the agent utilizing 91.86% and the broker 97.88% of free heap after cryptographic operations, and successfully rejects 100% of unauthorized access attempts with sub-millisecond average latency.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21768v1\n    "}}

These legacy schemes rely on a monolithic identity root with no inherent context isolation, algorithm agility, or secure secret rotation. This paper introduces MSCIKDF, a single-root, multi-curve, context-isolated, PQC-pluggable cryptographic identity primitive. MSCIKDF defines a new architectural foundation where identity is derived deterministically but with cryptographically enforced separation across diverse contexts (e.g., blockchain, E2EE, KMS, IoT). It achieves strong security invariants -- such as zero-linkability, multi-curve independence, and resistance to cross-context correlation -- while offering stateless secret rotation that preserves long-term identity continuity without requiring asset migration. MSCIKDF is proposed as an infrastructure-level upgrade to deterministic identity, establishing a durable and algorithm-agnostic root of trust suitable for the next decade of distributed systems, AI agents, and PQC migration.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20505v1\n    "}}

Traditional machine learning detectors struggle with class imbalance, high dimensional features, and scarce real world traces. They often lack transferability-performing well in the training domain but degrading in novel attack scenarios. We propose a hybrid transfer framework that integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks to improve cross-domain generalization. An attention-based autoencoder supports knowledge transfer across domains, while Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) select stable, informative features to reduce dimensionality and computational cost. A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift. We evaluate on real-world traces from the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) program and augment with synthetic attack scenarios to test robustness. Across source to target transfers, the approach delivers improved detection scores with classical and deep baselines, demonstrating a scalable, explainable, and transferable solution for APT detection.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20500v1\n    "}}

Modern supervised learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that leverages AutoEncoders for unsupervised anomaly detection, augmented by active learning to iteratively improve the detection of APT anomalies. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\\% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The results have shown significant improvements in detection rates during active learning and better performance compared to other existing approaches.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20480v1\n    "}}

The case of primes $P\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ is analyzed, where two constructive types of solutions arise: ED1 (exactly one denominator divisible by $P$, namely $C=cP$) and ED2 (exactly two denominators divisible by $P$, namely $B=bP$ and $C=cP$). Parametric constructions and enumeration algorithms are developed, including explicit transitions between ED1 and ED2.\n  A deterministic algorithm is proposed, based on the intersection of a parametric lattice defined by pairs $(\u03b1,d')$ with bounded boxes. For each fixed prime $P\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ the algorithm constructively produces a solution. Using analytic methods such as the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem and the Chebotarev density theorem, it is shown that the density of admissible parameters is high, which yields polylogarithmic search complexity in the average case. A strict complexity guarantee for all primes remains conditional and depends on the finite covering hypothesis.\n  This study extends previous work for coefficient $4$ (the Erd\u0151s--Straus conjecture) to coefficient $5$, transferring the same structure of parametrization and constructive solutions.

To this end, there has been significant recent interest in State-Machine-Replication (SMR) protocols that achieve 2-round finality under the assumption that $5f+1\\leq n$, where $n$ is the number of processors and $f$ bounds the number of processors that may exhibit Byzantine faults. In these protocols, instructions are organised into views, each led by a different designated leader, and 2-round finality means that a leader's proposal can be finalised after just a single round of voting, meaning two rounds overall (one round for the proposal and one for voting).\n  We introduce Minimmit, a Byzantine-fault-tolerant SMR protocol with lower latency than previous 2-round finality approaches. Our key insight is that view progression and transaction finality can operate on different quorum thresholds without compromising safety or liveness. Experiments simulating a globally distributed network of 50 processors, uniformly assigned across ten virtual regions, show that the approach leads to a 23.1% reduction in view latency and a 10.7% reduction in transaction latency compared to the state-of-the-art.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10862v5\n    "}}

By collecting both experimental data from a quantum processing unit (QPU) in analog mode and numerical benchmarks, we enable accurate predictions of run-time and energy consumption for large-scale simulations on both QPUs and classical systems through fitting of theoretical scaling laws.

With a small tilt, the fermions are still localized and form a Mott-insulating state, where the localized spins interact via antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. While the localized state is naively expected to be broken with a large tilt, in fact, the fermions are still localized under a large tilt due to the Wannier-Stark localization and it can be regarded as a localized spin system. We find that the sign of the exchange coupling is changed and the ferromagnetic interaction is realized under the large tilt. To show this, we employ perturbation theory and real-time numerical simulation of the fermionic Hubbard chain. Our simulation exhibits that it is possible to effectively control the speed and time direction of the dynamics by changing the size of the tilt, which may be useful for experimentally measuring out-of-time-ordered correlators. Finally, we discuss experimental platforms, such as ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, to observe these phenomena.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03857v2\n    "}}

Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15236v3\n    "}}

By adopting this formulation, we can reinterpret the infinitesimal average heat in terms of the infinitesimal change of the passive state associated with the density operator behind the quantum dynamics. Such as entropy, this leads to a heat concept that is invariant under passive state transformations. As an application, the average heat can be used as a general non-Markovianity measure for unital maps. Moreover, a positive-semidefinite temperature naturally emerges in an out-of-equilibrium ergotropy-based scenario. Concerning the infinitesimal average work, it arises as the infinitesimal variation of ergotropy, as well as an extra passive work contribution in the case of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. As illustrations, we consider the thermodynamics of a single-qubit open system in the cases of generalized amplitude-damping and phase-damping channels.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07200v3\n    "}}

This article reviews recent literature addressing key issues in LLM security, with a focus on accuracy, bias, content detection, and vulnerability to attacks. Issues related to inaccurate or misleading outputs from LLMs is discussed, with emphasis on the implementation from fact-checking methodologies to enhance response reliability. Inherent biases within LLMs are critically examined through diverse evaluation techniques, including controlled input studies and red teaming exercises. A comprehensive analysis of bias mitigation strategies is presented, including approaches from pre-processing interventions to in-training adjustments and post-processing refinements. The article also probes the complexity of distinguishing LLM-generated content from human-produced text, introducing detection mechanisms like DetectGPT and watermarking techniques while noting the limitations of machine learning enabled classifiers under intricate circumstances. Moreover, LLM vulnerabilities, including jailbreak attacks and prompt injection exploits, are analyzed by looking into different case studies and large-scale competitions like HackAPrompt. This review is concluded by retrospecting defense mechanisms to safeguard LLMs, accentuating the need for more extensive research into the LLM security field.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08087v3\n    "}}

Their minimum distance is bounded below by a function of the gonality of the underlying function field. Known explicit examples--coming mostly from elliptic and Hermitian curves--typically meet this lower bound. In this paper, we construct, for every integer $n \\geqslant 4$, a new family of lattices arising from the Fermat function field $F_n$ and the set of its $3n$ total inflection points. These lattices have rank $3n-1$, and we show that their minimum distance equals $\\sqrt{2n}$, thereby exceeding the classical bound $\\sqrt{2\u03b3(F_n)} = \\sqrt{2(n-1)}$. We also determine their kissing number, which turns out to be independent of $n$, and analyze the structure of the second shortest vectors. Our results provide the first explicit examples of function field lattices of arbitrarily large rank whose minimum distance surpasses the expected bound, offering new geometric features of potential interest for coding-theoretic and cryptographic applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20316v1\n    "}}

This paper presents a large-scale empirical study on 2,414 open-source repositories to address these issues from a practical standpoint. First, we demonstrate that using lock files with strong package managers enables the generation of accurate and consistent SBOMs, establishing a reliable foundation for security analysis. Using this high-fidelity foundation, however, we expose a more fundamental flaw in practice: downstream vulnerability scanners produce a staggering 97.5\\% false positive rate. We pinpoint the primary cause as the flagging of vulnerabilities within unreachable code. We then demonstrate that function call analysis can effectively prune 63.3\\% of these false alarms. Our work validates a practical, two-stage approach for SSC security: first, generate an accurate SBOM using lock files and strong package managers, and second, enrich it with function call analysis to produce actionable, low-noise vulnerability reports that alleviate developers' alert fatigue.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20313v1\n    "}}

First, we formulate sum rate (SR) and energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems in a unified framework, subject to constraints on the movable region of PAs, total power budget, and tunable phase of RIS elements. Then, by leveraging a graph-structured topology of the RIS-assisted PASS, a novel three-stage graph neural network (GNN) is proposed, which learns PA positions based on user locations, and RIS phase shifts according to composite channel conditions at the first two stages, respectively, and finally determines beamforming vectors. Specifically, the proposed GNN is achieved through unsupervised training, together with three implementation strategies for its integration with convex optimization, thus offering trade-offs between inference time and solution optimality. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN, and to support its unique attributes of viable generalization capability, good performance reliability, and real-time applicability. Moreover, the impact of key parameters on RIS-assisted PASS is illustrated and analyzed.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20305v1\n    "}}

This breakthrough result was established by Mochon in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114]. However, his proof relied on the existence of certain unitary operators which was established by a non-constructive argument. Consequently, explicit protocols have remained elusive. In this work, we give exact constructions of related unitary operators.

This also leads to potentially redundant/noisy features that may decrease the accuracy of the detection engine in IDSs. This paper first introduces a novel neural network architecture called Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder (MIAE). MIAE consists of multiple sub-encoders that can process inputs from different sources with different characteristics. The MIAE model is trained in an unsupervised learning mode to transform the heterogeneous inputs into lower-dimensional representation, which helps classifiers distinguish between normal behaviour and different types of attacks. To distil and retain more relevant features but remove less important/redundant ones during the training process, we further design and embed a feature selection layer right after the representation layer of MIAE resulting in a new model called MIAEFS. This layer learns the importance of features in the representation vector, facilitating the selection of informative features from the representation vector. The results on three IDS datasets, i.e., NSLKDD, UNSW-NB15, and IDS2017, show the superior performance of MIAE and MIAEFS compared to other methods, e.g., conventional classifiers, dimensionality reduction models, unsupervised representation learning methods with different input dimensions, and unsupervised feature selection models. Moreover, MIAE and MIAEFS combined with the Random Forest (RF) classifier achieve accuracy of 96.5% in detecting sophisticated attacks, e.g., Slowloris. The average running time for detecting an attack sample using RF with the representation of MIAE and MIAEFS is approximate 1.7E-6 seconds, whilst the model size is lower than 1 MB.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15511v2\n    "}}

A fundamental challenge in this paradigm lies in the modality gap -- the structural and semantic disconnect between provenance graphs and CTI reports. Prior work addresses this by framing threat hunting as a graph matching task: 1) extracting attack graphs from CTI reports, and 2) aligning them with provenance graphs. However, this pipeline incurs severe \\textit{information loss} during graph extraction and demands intensive manual curation, undermining scalability and effectiveness.\n  In this paper, we present APT-CGLP, a novel cross-modal APT hunting system via Contrastive Graph-Language Pre-training, facilitating end-to-end semantic matching between provenance graphs and CTI reports without human intervention. First, empowered by the Large Language Model (LLM), APT-CGLP mitigates data scarcity by synthesizing high-fidelity provenance graph-CTI report pairs, while simultaneously distilling actionable insights from noisy web-sourced CTIs to improve their operational utility. Second, APT-CGLP incorporates a tailored multi-objective training algorithm that synergizes contrastive learning with inter-modal masked modeling, promoting cross-modal attack semantic alignment at both coarse- and fine-grained levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world APT datasets demonstrate that APT-CGLP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art threat hunting baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20290v1\n    "}}

Typically, these decisions are made by users during app installation or at runtime. Due to the increasing complexity and automation of systems, making these access control decisions can add a significant cognitive load on users, often overloading them and leading to suboptimal or even arbitrary access control decisions. To address this problem, we propose to leverage the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to make dynamic, context-aware decisions aligned with the user's security preferences. For this purpose, we conducted a user study, which resulted in a dataset of 307 natural-language privacy statements and 14,682 access control decisions made by users. We then compare these decisions against those made by two versions of LLMs: a general and a personalized one, for which we also gathered user feedback on 1,446 of its decisions.\n  Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users. Our study also reveals a crucial trade-off in personalizing such a system: while providing user-specific privacy preferences to the LLM generally improves agreement with individual user decisions, adhering to those preferences can also violate some security best practices. Based on our findings, we discuss design and risk considerations for implementing a practical natural-language-based access control system that balances personalization, security, and utility.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20284v1\n    "}}

Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20255v1\n    "}}

You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy\n    summary: WhatsApp, with 3.5 billion active accounts as of early 2025, is the world's largest instant messaging platform. Given its massive user base, WhatsApp plays a critical role in global communication.\n  To initiate conversations, users must first discover whether their contacts are registered on the platform. This is achieved by querying WhatsApp's servers with mobile phone numbers extracted from the user's address book (if they allowed access). This architecture inherently enables phone number enumeration, as the service must allow legitimate users to query contact availability. While rate limiting is a standard defense against abuse, we revisit the problem and show that WhatsApp remains highly vulnerable to enumeration at scale. In our study, we were able to probe over a hundred million phone numbers per hour without encountering blocking or effective rate limiting.\n  Our findings demonstrate not only the persistence but the severity of this vulnerability. We further show that nearly half of the phone numbers disclosed in the 2021 Facebook data leak are still active on WhatsApp, underlining the enduring risks associated with such exposures. Moreover, we were able to perform a census of WhatsApp users, providing a glimpse on the macroscopic insights a large messaging service is able to generate even though the messages themselves are end-to-end encrypted. Using the gathered data, we also discovered the re-use of certain X25519 keys across different devices and phone numbers, indicating either insecure (custom) implementations, or fraudulent activity.\n  In this updated version of the paper, we also provide insights into the collaborative remediation process through which we confirmed that the underlying rate-limiting issue had been resolved.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20252v1\n    "}}

The work of many authors has shown that, for $p>37$, this representation is either surjective or has image contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup $C_{ns}^+(p)$. Zywina has further proved that, whenever $\u03c1_{E,p}$ is not surjective for $p>37$, its image is either $C_{ns}^+(p)$ or a certain subgroup $G(p)$ of $C_{ns}^+(p)$ of index $3$. Recently, Le Fourn and Lemos showed that the index-$3$ case cannot arise for $p>1.4 \\cdot 10^7$. We strengthen this result by proving that the image of $\u03c1_{E, p}$ is not conjugate to $G(p)$ for any prime larger than $5$.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17780v2\n    "}}

While Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been used to model uncertainty, they assume full state observability - an assumption that breaks down in partitioned DTNs, where each node operates with inherently partial knowledge of the network state. In this work, we investigate the role of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for DTN routing under uncertainty. We introduce and evaluate a novel model: Dependent Node Failures (DNF), which captures correlated node failures via repairable node states modeled as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). We implement the model using JuliaPOMDP and integrate it with DTN simulations via DtnSim. Our evaluation demonstrates that POMDP-based routing yields improved delivery ratios and delay performance under uncertain conditions while maintaining scalability. These results highlight the potential of POMDPs as a principled foundation for decision-making in future DTN deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20241v1\n    "}}

While prior work has focused on detecting such activity, identifying specific malware families and their behaviors from captured network traffic remains challenging due to the variability of DNS. In this paper, we present the first application of Locality Sensitive Hashing to the detection and identification of real-world malware utilizing DNS covert channels. Our approach encodes DNS subdomain sequences into statistical similarity features that effectively capture anomalies indicative of malicious activity. Combined with a Random Forest classifier, our method achieves higher accuracy and reduced false positive rates than prior approaches, while demonstrating improved robustness and generalization to previously unseen or modified malware samples. We further demonstrate that our approach enables reliable classification of malware behavior (e.g., uploading or downloading of files), based solely on DNS subdomains.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20229v1\n    "}}

However, existing ROI-based video encryption methods suffer from insufficient flexibility and lack of a unified evaluation system. To address these issues, we propose a visual perception-based tunable framework and evaluation benchmark for H.265/HEVC ROI encryption. Our scheme introduces three key contributions: 1) A ROI region recognition module based on visual perception network is proposed to accurately identify the ROI region in videos. 2) A three-level tunable encryption strategy is implemented while balancing security and real-time performance. 3) A unified ROI encryption evaluation benchmark is developed to provide a standardized quantitative platform for subsequent research. This triple strategy provides new solution and significant unified performance evaluation methods for ROI selective encryption field. Experimental results indicate that the proposed benchmark can comprehensively measure the performance of the ROI selective encryption.

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), leveraging their ability to understand code semantics has emerged as a promising direction for achieving more accurate and efficient vulnerability detection. However, current LLM-based approaches face significant challenges: instability in model outputs, degraded performance with long context, and hallucination. As a result, many existing solutions either use LLMs merely to enrich predefined rule sets, thereby keeping the detection process fundamentally rule-based, or over-rely on them, leading to poor robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a constraint-solving approach powered by LLMs named VULSOLVER. By modeling vulnerability detection as a constraint-solving problem, and by integrating static application security testing (SAST) with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs, our method enables the LLM to act like a professional human security expert. We assess VULSOLVER on the OWASP Benchmark (1,023 labeled samples), achieving 97.85% accuracy, 97.97% F1-score, and 100% recall. Applied to widely-used open-source projects, VULSOLVER identified 15 previously unknown high-severity vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.5-9.8), demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world security analysis.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00882v5\n    "}}

However, the evaluation of these methods remains neither standardized nor reliable. First, there are severe inconsistencies in the evaluation settings across studies, and many rely on unrealistic threat models. Second, our code review uncovers semantic bugs in the official codebases of several attacks that artificially inflate their reported performance. These issues raise fundamental questions about whether current methods are truly effective or simply overfitted to narrow experimental setups. We introduce \\textbf{BackFed}, a benchmark designed to standardize and stress-test FL backdoor evaluation by unifying attacks and defenses under a common evaluation framework that mirrors realistic FL deployments. Our benchmark on three representative datasets with three distinct architectures reveals critical limitations of existing methods. Malicious clients often require excessive training time and computation, making them vulnerable to server-enforced time constraints. Meanwhile, several defenses incur severe accuracy degradation or aggregation overhead. Popular defenses and attacks achieve limited performance in our benchmark, which challenges their previous efficacy claims. We establish BackFed as a rigorous and fair evaluation framework that enables more reliable progress in FL backdoor research.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04903v2\n    "}}

This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20142v1\n    "}}

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20100v1\n    "}}

While this paradigm enhances functionality, it also introduces a fundamental security shift: LLMs transition from passive information processors to autonomous orchestrators of task-oriented toolchains, expanding the attack surface, elevating adversarial goals from manipulating single outputs to hijacking entire execution flows. In this paper, we reveal a new class of attacks, Parasitic Toolchain Attacks, instantiated as MCP Unintended Privacy Disclosure (MCP-UPD). These attacks require no direct victim interaction; instead, adversaries embed malicious instructions into external data sources that LLMs access during legitimate tasks. The malicious logic infiltrates the toolchain and unfolds in three phases: Parasitic Ingestion, Privacy Collection, and Privacy Disclosure, culminating in stealthy exfiltration of private data. Our root cause analysis reveals that MCP lacks both context-tool isolation and least-privilege enforcement, enabling adversarial instructions to propagate unchecked into sensitive tool invocations. To assess the severity, we design MCP-SEC and conduct the first large-scale security census of the MCP ecosystem, analyzing 12,230 tools across 1,360 servers. Our findings show that the MCP ecosystem is rife with exploitable gadgets and diverse attack methods, underscoring systemic risks in MCP platforms and the urgent need for defense mechanisms in LLM-integrated environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06572v2\n    "}}

To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14301v2\n    "}}

Such fragmentation stems from the use of online GPU memory allocators in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which disregard tensor lifespans. As a result, this inefficiency can waste as much as 43% of memory and trigger out-of-memory errors, undermining the effectiveness of optimization methods. To address this, we introduce STAlloc, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STAlloc introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch memory allocator, STAlloc reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 85.1% (up to 100%) across both dense and MoE models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves throughput performance by up to 32.5%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v2\n    "}}

However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.\n  This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying \"non-motorized lane\" signs as \"motorized lane\" and \"pedestrian\" as \"plastic bag\".\n  To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20002v1\n    "}}

SwitchDelta uses a best-effort data plane design to overcome the resource limitation of switches and designs a novel metadata update protocol to exploit the benefits of in-network data visibility.

However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19966v1\n    "}}

Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning LLMs, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for communication and computation to enhance communication efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed ParaBlock achieves the same convergence rate as the standard federated block coordinate descent methods. Empirical evaluations on fine-tuning LLMs on general instruction following and mathematical reasoning confirm that ParaBlock not only maintains strong performance but also significantly improves communication efficiency.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19959v1\n    "}}

While cloud-native RDBMSs provide elastic computing resources via disaggregated computing and storage, storage costs remain a critical user concern. Consequently, data compression emerges as an effective strategy to reduce storage costs. However, existing compression approaches in RDBMSs present a stark trade-off: software-based approaches incur significant performance overheads, while hardware-based alternatives lack the flexibility required for diverse database workloads. In this paper, we present PolarStore, a compressed shared storage system for cloud-native RDBMSs. PolarStore employs a dual-layer compression mechanism that combines in-storage compression in PolarCSD hardware with lightweight compression in software. This design leverages the strengths of both approaches. PolarStore also incorporates database-oriented optimizations to maintain high performance on critical I/O paths. Drawing from large-scale deployment experiences, we also introduce hardware improvements for PolarCSD to ensure host-level stability and propose a compression-aware scheduling scheme to improve cluster-level space efficiency. PolarStore is currently deployed on thousands of storage servers within PolarDB, managing over 100 PB of data. It achieves a compression ratio of 3.55 and reduces storage costs by approximately 60%. Remarkably, these savings are achieved while maintaining performance comparable to uncompressed clusters.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19949v1\n    "}}

As the dimensions of the matrix grow rapidly, the computational cost increases significantly, posing a serious challenge to the efficiency of data analysis and signal processing systems, especially in time-sensitive scenarios involving large-scale datasets. Although various dedicated hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate the computation of intensive SVD, many of these designs suffer from limited scalability and high consumption of on-chip memory resources. Moreover, they typically overlook the computational and data transfer challenges associated with SVD, making them unsuitable for real-time processing of large-scale data stream matrices in embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a Data Stream-Based SVD processing algorithm (DSB Jacobi), which significantly reduces on-chip BRAM usage while improving computational speed, offering a practical solution for real-time SVD computation of large-scale data streams. Compared to previous works, our experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces on-chip RAM consumption by 41.5 percent and improves computational efficiency by a factor of 23.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12461v3\n    "}}

This study introduces a reproducible framework for analysing eight polymorphic behaviours-junk code insertion, control-flow obfuscation, packing, data encoding, domain generation, randomized beacon timing, protocol mimicry, and format/header tweaks-and evaluates their detectability across three layers: commercial AVs, custom rule-based detectors (YARA/Sigma), and endpoint detection and response (EDR) telemetry. Eleven inert polymorphic variants were generated per behaviour using controlled mutation engines and executed in isolated environments. Detection performance was assessed by detection rate (DR), false positive rate (FPR), and combined coverage. AVs achieved an average DR of 34%, YARA/Sigma 74% and EDR 76%; integrated detection reached ~92% with an FPR of 3.5%. Iterative YARA tuning showed a trade-off between detection and FPR, while behaviour-specific trends revealed static polymorphisms were best caught by custom rules, dynamic by EDR, and network-level by Sigma-like analysis. These results affirm that hybrid detection pipelines combining static, dynamic, and network-layer analytics offer resilient defence against polymorphic malware and form a baseline for future adaptive detection research.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21764v1\n    "}}

However, SAFL faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD) and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL. FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their local training based on data distribution characteristics and available computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning.

With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, \"hidden\" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization\" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503v4\n    "}}

The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344v3\n    "}}

Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.\n  To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval.

Yet, a fundamental challenge persists: how can we verify the correctness of AI model inference when model owners cannot (or will not) reveal their parameters? These parameters represent enormous training costs and valuable intellectual property, making transparent verification difficult. In this paper, we introduce a zero-knowledge framework capable of verifying deep learning inference without exposing model internal parameters. Built on recursively composed zero-knowledge proofs and requiring no trusted setup, our framework supports both linear and nonlinear neural network layers, including matrix multiplication, normalization, softmax, and SiLU. Leveraging the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, we obtain a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) with constant-size proofs. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we translate the DeepSeek model into a fully SNARK-verifiable version named ZK-DeepSeek and show experimentally that our framework delivers both efficiency and flexibility in real-world AI verification workloads.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19902v1\n    "}}

Generalizability and robustness are two critical concerns of a forgery detector, determining its reliability when facing unknown GANs and noisy samples in an open world. Although many studies focus on improving these two properties, the root causes of these problems have not been fully explored, and it is unclear if there is a connection between them. Moreover, despite recent achievements in addressing these issues from image forensic or anti-forensic aspects, a universal method that can contribute to both sides simultaneously remains practically significant yet unavailable. In this paper, we provide a fundamental explanation of these problems from a frequency perspective. Our analysis reveals that the frequency bias of a DNN forgery detector is a possible cause of generalization and robustness issues. Based on this finding, we propose a two-step frequency alignment method to remove the frequency discrepancy between real and fake images, offering double-sided benefits: it can serve as a strong black-box attack against forgery detectors in the anti-forensic context or, conversely, as a universal defense to improve detector reliability in the forensic context. We also develop corresponding attack and defense implementations and demonstrate their effectiveness, as well as the effect of the frequency alignment method, in various experimental settings involving twelve detectors, eight forgery models, and five metrics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19886v1\n    "}}

These agents, modelled as autonomous physical or software entities, possess local computation power, finite memory and have the ability to traverse a graph, offering efficient solutions to a range of classical problems. In this work, we focus on the problem of computing a \\emph{minimal dominating set} (mDS) in anonymous graphs using mobile agents. Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \\emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19880v1\n    "}}

Existing approaches suffer from limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2% IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%. Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers, IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23053v2\n    "}}

While previous work has demonstrated behavioral backdoor detection within individual LLM architectures, the critical question of cross-LLM generalization remains unexplored, a gap with serious implications for organizations deploying multiple AI systems. We present the first systematic study of cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection, evaluating generalization across six production LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS 120B, and DeepSeek Chat V3.1). Through 1,198 execution traces and 36 cross-model experiments, we quantify a critical finding: single-model detectors achieve 92.7% accuracy within their training distribution but only 49.2% across different LLMs, a 43.4 percentage point generalization gap equivalent to random guessing. Our analysis reveals that this gap stems from model-specific behavioral signatures, particularly in temporal features (coefficient of variation > 0.8), while structural features remain stable across architectures. We show that model-aware detection incorporating model identity as an additional feature achieves 90.6% accuracy universally across all evaluated models. We release our multi-LLM trace dataset and detection framework to enable reproducible research.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19874v1\n    "}}

A particularly challenging scenario arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18549v3\n    "}}

With the growing demand for high performance uplink throughput from novel applications such as Metaverse, Internet of Things (IoTs) and Smart City, 3GPP introduced High Power User Equipment (HPUE) on 5G TDD bands, allowing UEs to utilize more than 23 dBm of power for transmission to improve throughput, QoE, and reliability, especially at the cell edges. In this paper, the performance of HPUE is evaluated in the urban area on a commercial 5G network in terms of Uplink Throughput, Modulation Efficiency, Re-transmission Rate (ReTx Rate), and Power Consumption in both Standalone (SA) and Non-Standalone (NSA) modes.

With the introduction of 5G, the support of UL-256QAM has been greatly improved due to a big re-haul of RAN by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). However, many RAN manufacturers charge MNOs for licenses to enable UL-256QAM per cell basis. This led to some MNOs hesitating to enable the feature on some of their gNodeB or cells to save cost.\n  Since it's known that 256QAM modulation requires a very good channel condition to operate, but UE has a very limited transmission power budget. In this paper, 256QAM utilization, throughput and latency impact from enabling UL-256QAM will be evaluated on commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in two countries: Japan and Thailand on various frequency bands, mobility characteristics, and deployment schemes. By modifying the modem firmware, UL-256QAM can be turned off and compared to the conventional UL-64QAM. The results show that UL-256QAM utilization was less than 20% when deployed on a passive antenna network resulting in an average of 8.22% improvement in throughput. However, with Massive MIMO deployment, more than 50% utilization was possible on commercial networks. Furthermore, despite a small uplink throughput gain, enabling UL-256QAM can lower the latency when the link is fully loaded with an average improvement of 7.97 ms in TCP latency observed across various test cases with two TCP congestion control algorithms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19870v1\n    "}}

To address this, the 5G New Radio (NR) standard introduced key uplink enhancements, including Uplink Multi-Input Multi-Output (UL-MIMO) and Uplink 256QAM, to improve throughput and spectral efficiency. However, while the benefits of these features for raw data rates are well-documented, their practical impact on real-time applications like live-streaming is not yet well understood. This paper investigates the performance of UL-MIMO and UL-256QAM for HD live-streaming over a commercial 5G network using the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). To ensure a fair assessment, we conduct a comparative analysis by modifying the modem firmware of commercial User Equipment (UE), allowing these features to be selectively enabled and disabled on the same device.

Mobile traffic generation can proactively anticipate user demands and capture the dynamics of network load. However, existing methods mainly focus on generating traffic at a single spatiotemporal resolution, making it difficult to jointly model multi-scale traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ZoomDiff, a diffusion-based model for multi-scale mobile traffic generation. ZoomDiff maps urban environmental context into mobile traffic with multiple spatial and temporal resolutions through a set of customized Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM). DRDM employs a multi-stage noise-adding and denoising mechanism, enabling different stages to generate traffic at distinct spatiotemporal resolutions. This design aligns the progressive denoising process with hierarchical network layers, including base stations, cells, and grids of varying granularities. Experiments on real-world mobile traffic datasets show that ZoomDiff achieves at least an 18.4% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in multi-scale traffic generation tasks. Moreover, ZoomDiff demonstrates strong efficiency and cross-city generalization, highlighting its potential as a powerful generative framework for modeling multi-scale mobile network dynamics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17532v2\n    "}}

While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence to the target accuracy compared to existing methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19851v1\n    "}}

In this paper, we take image generation as a representative application and propose a batch denoising framework, followed by a joint optimization of content generation and transmission, with the objective of maximizing the average AIGC service quality under an end-to-end service delay constraint. Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising. The STACKING operates independently of any specific form of the content quality function and achieves lower computational complexity. Building on the batch solution, we further optimize bandwidth allocation across AIGC services. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm in delivering high-quality, lower-latency AIGC services.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19847v1\n    "}}

Here, we demonstrate how new physics is uncovered by leveraging quantum optimal control techniques to design Floquet amplitude modulation profiles. We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve >99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities. Our findings demonstrate that optimally prepared non-equilibrium quantum states can access transport regimes not achievable in the corresponding equilibrium system or even by applying conventional Floquet approaches, opening new avenues for ultrafast quantum technologies and topological device applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19843v1\n    "}}

However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system's design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19832v1\n    "}}

As GPU architectures evolve and high-performance AI becomes increasingly important, optimizing GEMM performance becomes a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed. This paper introduces Stream-K++, an enhancement to the promising Stream-K GEMM scheduling algorithm for workload balancing. We expand Stream-K's scheduling policies from three to seven and implement an efficient solution selection mechanism using Bloom filters. Our approach rapidly eliminates up to 95.8% of unsuitable configurations while maintaining a 100% true-negative rate.\n  Implemented using the AMD Composable Kernel library and evaluated on AMD Instinct MI250X GPUs, Stream-K++ demonstrates significant performance gains (up to 43%) in select scenarios. It remains competitive (within 20% of optimal) for 60-97.6% of problem sizes. Our flexible framework, implemented in the Open-sieve C++ library, allows for easy adaptation to new problem sizes, scheduling policies, or additional tuning parameters, paving the way for future optimizations in GPU-based GEMM operations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11417v2\n    "}}

Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05362v3\n    "}}

Applying DP requires making several implementation decisions, each with significant impacts on data privacy and/or utility. Hence, to promote shared learning and accountability around DP deployments, Dwork, Kohli, and Mulligan (2019) proposed a public-facing repository (\"registry\") of DP deployments. The DP community has recently started to work toward realizing this vision. We contribute to this effort by (1) developing a holistic, hierarchical schema to describe any given DP deployment and (2) designing and implementing an interactive interface to act as a registry where practitioners can access information about past DP deployments. We (3) populate our interface with 21 real-world DP deployments and (4) conduct an exploratory user study with DP practitioners ($n=16$) to understand how they would use the registry, as well as what challenges and opportunities they foresee around its adoption. We find that participants were enthusiastic about the registry as a valuable resource for evaluating prior deployments and making future deployments. They also identified several opportunities for the registry, including that it can become a \"hub\" for the community and support broader communication around DP (e.g., to legal teams). At the same time, they identified challenges around the registry gaining adoption, including the effort and risk involved with making implementation choices public and moderating the quality of entries. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for encouraging adoption and increasing the registry's value not only to DP practitioners, but also to policymakers, data users, and data subjects.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13509v2\n    "}}

Traditional GPU communication follows a host-initiated model, where the CPU orchestrates all communication operations - a characteristic of the CUDA runtime. Although robust for collective operations, applications requiring tight integration of computation and communication can benefit from device-initiated communication that eliminates CPU coordination overhead.\n  NCCL 2.28 introduces the Device API with three operation modes: Load/Store Accessible (LSA) for NVLink/PCIe, Multimem for NVLink SHARP, and GPU-Initiated Networking (GIN) for network RDMA. This paper presents the GIN architecture, design, semantics, and highlights its impact on MoE communication. GIN builds on a three-layer architecture: i) NCCL Core host-side APIs for device communicator setup and collective memory window registration; ii) Device-side APIs for remote memory operations callable from CUDA kernels; and iii) A network plugin architecture with dual semantics (GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated and Proxy) for broad hardware support. The GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated backend leverages DOCA GPUNetIO for direct GPU-to-NIC communication, while the Proxy backend provides equivalent functionality via lock-free GPU-to-CPU queues over standard RDMA networks.

As such, one could naturally assume that circuits implementing symplectic transformations would attract similar attention. However, this is not the case, as $\\mathbb{SP} (d/2)$ -- the group of $d\\times d$ unitary symplectic matrices -- has thus far been overlooked. In this work, we aim at starting to fill this gap. We begin by presenting a universal set of generators $\\mathcal{G}$ for the symplectic algebra $\\mathfrak{sp}(d/2)$, consisting of one- and two-qubit Pauli operators acting on neighboring sites in a one-dimensional lattice. Here, we uncover two critical differences between such set, and equivalent ones for unitary and orthogonal circuits. Namely, we find that the operators in $\\mathcal{G}$ cannot generate arbitrary local symplectic unitaries and that they are not translationally invariant. We then review the Schur-Weyl duality between the symplectic group and the Brauer algebra, and use tools from Weingarten calculus to prove that Pauli measurements at the output of Haar random symplectic circuits can converge to Gaussian processes. As a by-product, such analysis provides us with concentration bounds for Pauli measurements in circuits that form $t$-designs over $\\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$. To finish, we present tensor-network tools to analyze shallow random symplectic circuits, and we use these to numerically show that computational-basis measurements anti-concentrate at logarithmic depth.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10264v3\n    "}}

This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710v1\n    "}}

Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06187v2\n    "}}

Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20709v1\n    "}}

We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples. Our approach is platform-agnostic and can be incrementally deployed as a security layer above existing LLM infrastructure, with the expectation that future models will be trained with native fence awareness for optimal security.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19727v1\n    "}}

MPC-based ML allows multiple parties to collaboratively run an ML workload without sharing their private data or model parameters using multi-party computing (MPC). Because MPC cannot natively run ML operations such as Softmax or GELU, existing frameworks use different approximations. Our study shows that, on a well-optimized framework, these approximations often become the dominating bottleneck. Popular approximations are often insufficiently accurate or unnecessarily slow, and these issues are hard to identify and fix in existing frameworks. To tackle this issue, we propose a compiler for MPC-based ML, CrypTorch. CrypTorch disentangles these approximations with the rest of the MPC runtime, allows easily adding new approximations through its programming interface, and automatically selects approximations to maximize both performance and accuracy. Built as an extension to PyTorch 2's compiler, we show that CrypTorch's auto-tuning alone provides 1.20--1.7$\\times$ immediate speedup without sacrificing accuracy, and 1.31--1.8$\\times$ speedup when some accuracy degradation is allowed, compared to our well-optimized baseline. Combined with better engineering and adoption of state-of-the-art practices, the entire framework brings 3.22--8.6$\\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the popular framework, CrypTen.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19711v1\n    "}}

The C programming language, prevalent in CPS development, is crucial for system control where reliability is critical. However, it is also commonly susceptible to vulnerabilities, particularly buffer overflows. Traditional vulnerability discovery techniques often struggle with scalability and precision when applied directly to the binary code of C programs, which can thereby keep programs vulnerable. This work introduces a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging model checking and concolic execution techniques to automatically verify security properties of a program's stack memory in binary code, trampoline techniques to perform automated repair of the issues, and crash-inducing inputs to verify if they were successfully removed. The approach constructs a Memory State Space -- MemStaCe -- from the binary program's control flow graph and simulations, provided by concolic execution, of C function calls and loop constructs. The security properties, defined in LTL, model the correct behaviour of functions associated with vulnerabilities and allow the approach to identify vulnerabilities in MemStaCe by analysing counterexample traces that are generated when a security property is violated. These vulnerabilities are then addressed with a trampoline-based binary patching method, and the effectiveness of the patches is checked with crash-inducing inputs extracted during concolic execution. We implemented the approach in the BASICS tool for BO mitigation and evaluated using the Juliet C/C++ and SARD datasets and real applications, achieving an accuracy and precision above 87%, both in detection and correction. Also, we compared it with CWE Checker, outperforming it.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19670v1\n    "}}

To combat this often unrealistic picture of homogeneous noise in quantum processors during runtime, our work aims to define the boundaries of acceptable defectiveness (BADs), or the upper boundary of a qubit's physical error, past which this defective qubit entirely degrades the logical computation and should be considered faulty and removed from the surface code mapping. Here, we present a simulation framework based on the stabilizer simulation package STIM, that allows for rapid experimentation of quantum error correction (QEC) performance under any arbitrary and unique noise model. Using this tool, QEC circuits using rotated surface codes were generated, sampled, and analyzed from distances 3 to 17, with various defective error rates and outlier defect locations. The results suggest that there are, in fact, boundaries of acceptable defectiveness in which a defective qubit, with a physical error rate $\\leq 0.75$, can be left in the lattice with negligible impact on logical error rate given sufficient code distances and proper placement in the lattice. Additionally, when modeling noise as a uniform distribution, the logical error rate shows minimal impact with increasing deviation, with $\u03c3\\leq \u03bc$. As a result, we propose that defectiveness of both individual qubits and the overall uniformity of lattice fidelity should not be viewed as all or nothing, but instead as a spectrum. Our research demonstrates how heterogeneity relates to the logical error rate and, through the framework provided, facilitates the development of preliminary goals and metrics for hardware designers to meet to achieve target logical performance with imperfect or nonuniform qubit qualities.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22001v2\n    "}}

Achieving trustworthy malware detection, particularly when LLMs are involved, remains a significant challenge. We developed an evaluation framework using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), and Semantic Similarity Metrics to benchmark explanation quality across five LoRA configurations and a fully fine-tuned baseline. Results indicate that full fine-tuning achieves the highest overall scores, with BLEU and ROUGE improvements of up to 10% over LoRA variants. However, mid-range LoRA models deliver competitive performance exceeding full fine-tuning on two metrics while reducing model size by approximately 81% and training time by over 80% on a LoRA model with 15.5% trainable parameters. These findings demonstrate that LoRA offers a practical balance of interpretability and resource efficiency, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments without sacrificing explanation quality. By providing feature-driven natural language explanations for malware classifications, this approach enhances transparency, analyst confidence, and operational scalability in malware detection systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19654v1\n    "}}

Attackers are now using Artificial Intelligence to create sophisticated malware variations that can easily evade traditional detection techniques. Although machine learning has shown promise in malware classification, its success relies heavily on the availability of up-to-date, high-quality datasets. The scarcity and high cost of obtaining and labeling real malware samples presents significant challenges in developing robust detection models. In this paper, we propose MalSynGen, a Malware Synthetic Data Generation methodology that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data. This data preserves the statistical properties of real-world data and improves the performance of Android malware classifiers. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using various datasets and metrics that assess the fidelity of the generated data, its utility in classification, and the computational efficiency of the process. Our experiments demonstrate that MalSynGen can generalize across different datasets, providing a viable solution to address the issues of obsolescence and low quality data in malware detection.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19649v1\n    "}}

Traditional intrusion detection and response systems often rely on static rules and manual workflows, which limit their ability to respond with the speed and precision required in high-stakes environments. To address these challenges, we present the Intrusion Response System Digital Assistant (IRSDA), an agent-based framework designed to deliver autonomous and policy-compliant cyber defense. IRSDA combines Self-Adaptive Autonomic Computing Systems (SA-ACS) with the Knowledge guided Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute (MAPE-K) loop to support real-time, partition-aware decision-making across enterprise infrastructure.\n  IRSDA incorporates a knowledge-driven architecture that integrates contextual information with AI-based reasoning to support system-guided intrusion response. The framework leverages retrieval mechanisms and structured representations to inform decision-making while maintaining alignment with operational policies. We assess the system using a representative real-world microservices application, demonstrating its ability to automate containment, enforce compliance, and provide traceable outputs for security analyst interpretation. This work outlines a modular and agent-driven approach to cyber defense that emphasizes explainability, system-state awareness, and operational control in intrusion response.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19644v1\n    "}}

In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19589v1\n    "}}

While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19368v1\n    "}}

These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

Yet, existing federated learning work largely overlooks the security risks that arise when local adaptation occurs at test time. Heterogeneous domain arrivals, diverse adaptation algorithms, and limited cross-client visibility create vulnerabilities where compromised participants can craft poisoned inputs and submit adversarial updates that undermine both global and per-client performance. To address this threat, we introduce FedPoisonTTP, a realistic grey-box attack framework that explores test-time data poisoning in the federated adaptation setting. FedPoisonTTP distills a surrogate model from adversarial queries, synthesizes in-distribution poisons using feature-consistency, and optimizes attack objectives to generate high-entropy or class-confident poisons that evade common adaptation filters. These poisons are injected during local adaptation and spread through collaborative updates, leading to broad degradation. Extensive experiments on corrupted vision benchmarks show that compromised participants can substantially diminish overall test-time performance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19248v1\n    "}}

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based localization algorithms presents potential for enhancing localization accuracy. Nevertheless, current standardization efforts in the third generation partnership project (3GPP) and the O-RAN Alliance do not support AI/ML-based localization. In order to close this standardization gap, this paper describes an O-RAN framework that enables the integration of AI/ML-based localization algorithms for real-time deployments and testing. Specifically, our framework includes an O-RAN E2 Service Model (E2SM) and the corresponding radio access network (RAN) function, which exposes the Uplink Sounding Reference Signal (UL-SRS) channel estimates from the E2 agent to the Near real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). Moreover, our framework includes, as an example, a real-time localization external application (xApp), which leverages the custom E2SM-SRS in order to execute continuous inference on a trained Channel Charting (CC) model, which is an emerging self-supervised method for radio-based localization. Our framework is implemented with OpenAirInterface (OAI) and FlexRIC, democratizing access to AI-driven positioning research and fostering collaboration. Furthermore, we validate our approach with the CC xApp in real-world conditions using an O-RAN based localization testbed at EURECOM. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our framework in enabling real-time AI/ML localization and show the potential of O-RAN in empowering positioning use cases for next-generation AI-native networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19233v1\n    "}}

We show that combining this flux-induced localization with engineered dissipation leads to robust spin synchronization in rotationally symmetric spin geometries, referred to as Aharonov-Bohm motifs, with cyclic symmetries of any order. The synchronized dynamics is independent of initial conditions and features entanglement among spins within each motif. We further demonstrate that multiple motifs can fully synchronize when coupled, which is achieved by applying additional collective dissipation acting on all intra-motif spins. These results reveal a direct connection between flux-induced localization, dissipative engineering, and collective quantum synchronization.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19219v1\n    "}}

Recently, platforms such as NDT, Ookla Speedtest and Cloudflare Speed Test have introduced metrics such as ``latency under load'' or ``working latency'' to fill this gap. Yet, the sensitivity of these metrics to basic network configurations such as Active Queue Management (AQM) remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the impact of AQM on speed test measurements in a laboratory setting. Using controlled experiments, we compare the distribution of throughput and latency under different load measurements across different AQM schemes, including CoDel, FQ-CoDel and Stochastic Fair Queuing (SFQ). On comparing with a standard drop-tail baseline, we find that measurements have high variance across AQM schemes and load conditions. These results highlight the critical role of AQM in shaping how emerging latency metrics should be interpreted, and underscore the need for careful calibration of speed test platforms before their results are used to guide policy or regulatory outcomes.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19213v1\n    "}}

This work focuses on two fundamental problems: leader election and spanning tree construction. For each problem, we present a constant-size (per edge), local certification scheme, where the conditions available to each node can only refer to the graph induced by its one-hop neighborhood. In particular, we provide certification schemes for leader election in chordal and $K_4$-free dismantlable graphs and for spanning tree construction in dismantlable graphs, assuming a root is given. For chordal graphs, our leader election certification scheme additionally ensures an acyclic orientation, a property that is not generally verifiable using constant-size certificates in arbitrary graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first local certification results tailored to these graph classes, potentially highlighting structural properties useful for verifying additional problems. Finally, we propose an algorithm that automatically transforms any certification scheme into a silent self-stabilizing algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that automatically recovers from faults) by adding only one extra state to the set of states of the certification scheme, assuming a Gouda fair scheduler. This transformation may be of independent interest.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19208v1\n    "}}

However, the resource-consuming reasoning processes may be exploited by attackers to maliciously occupy the resources of the servers, leading to a crash, like the DDoS attack in cyber. To this end, we propose a novel attack method on LRMs termed ExtendAttack to maliciously occupy the resources of servers by stealthily extending the reasoning processes of LRMs. Concretely, we systematically obfuscate characters within a benign prompt, transforming them into a complex, poly-base ASCII representation. This compels the model to perform a series of computationally intensive decoding sub-tasks that are deeply embedded within the semantic structure of the query itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ExtendAttack. Remarkably, it significantly increases response length and latency, with the former increasing by over 2.7 times for the o3 model on the HumanEval benchmark. Besides, it preserves the original meaning of the query and achieves comparable answer accuracy, showing the stealthiness.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13737v2\n    "}}

To meet both privacy and responsiveness demands, user data is embedded as vectors and stored in a vector database for fast similarity search. However, most existing vector databases target server-class environments. When ported directly to smartphones, two gaps emerge: (G1) a mismatch between mobile SoC constraints and vector-database assumptions, including tight bandwidth budgets, limited on-chip memory, and stricter data type and layout constraints; and (G2) a workload mismatch, because on-device usage resembles a continuously learning memory, in which queries must coexist with frequent inserts, deletions, and ongoing index maintenance. To address these challenges, we propose AME, an on-device Agentic Memory Engine co-designed with modern smartphone SoCs. AME introduces two key techniques: (1) a hardware-aware, high-efficiency matrix pipeline that maximizes compute-unit utilization and exploits multi-level on-chip storage to sustain high throughput; and (2) a hardware- and workload-aware scheduling scheme that coordinates querying, insertion, and index rebuilding to minimize latency. We implement AME on Snapdragon 8-series SoCs and evaluate it on HotpotQA. In our experiments, AME improves query throughput by up to 1.4x at matched recall, achieves up to 7x faster index construction, and delivers up to 6x higher insertion throughput under concurrent query workloads.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19192v1\n    "}}

Safety alignment aims to suppress specific concepts, yet evaluations seldom test whether safety persists under benign downstream fine-tuning routinely applied after deployment (e.g., LoRA personalization, style/domain adapters). We study the stability of current safety methods under benign fine-tuning and observe frequent breakdowns. As true safety alignment must withstand even benign post-deployment adaptations, we introduce the SPQR benchmark (Safety-Prompt adherence-Quality-Robustness). SPQR is a single-scored metric that provides a standardized and reproducible framework to evaluate how well safety-aligned diffusion models preserve safety, utility, and robustness under benign fine-tuning, by reporting a single leaderboard score to facilitate comparisons. We conduct multilingual, domain-specific, and out-of-distribution analyses, along with category-wise breakdowns, to identify when safety alignment fails after benign fine-tuning, ultimately showcasing SPQR as a concise yet comprehensive benchmark for T2I safety alignment techniques for T2I models.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19558v1\n    "}}

This paper proposes an unbiased, risk-aware framework for agentic negotiation, designed to ensure robust resource allocation in 6G network slicing. Specifically, agents leverage Digital Twins (DTs) to predict full latency distributions, which are then evaluated using a formal framework from extreme value theory, namely, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This approach fundamentally shifts the agent's objective from reasoning over the mean to reasoning over the tail, thereby building a statistically-grounded buffer against worst-case outcomes. Furthermore, our framework ensures full uncertainty awareness by requiring agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty -- confidence in their own DTs predictions -- and propagate this meta-verification to make robust decisions, preventing them from acting on unreliable data. We validate this framework in a 6G inter-slice negotiation use-case between an eMBB and a URLLC agent. The results demonstrate the profound failure of the biased, mean-based baseline, which consistently fails its SLAs with a 25\\% rate. Our unbiased, CVaR-aware agent successfully mitigates this bias, eliminating SLA violations and reducing the URLLC and eMBB p99.999 latencies by around 11\\%. We show this reliability comes at the rational and quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17\\%, exposing the false economy of the biased approach. This work provides a concrete methodology for building the trustworthy autonomous systems required for 6G.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19175v1\n    "}}

Benchmarking Potential Existential Threats from LLMs via Prefix Completion\n    summary: Research on the safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has become extensive, driven by jailbreak studies that elicit unsafe responses. Such response involves information already available to humans, such as the answer to \"how to make a bomb\". When LLMs are jailbroken, the practical threat they pose to humans is negligible. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs commonly produce unpredictable outputs that could pose substantive threats to human safety. To address this gap, we study whether LLM-generated content contains potential existential threats, defined as outputs that imply or promote direct harm to human survival. We propose \\textsc{ExistBench}, a benchmark designed to evaluate such risks. Each sample in \\textsc{ExistBench} is derived from scenarios where humans are positioned as adversaries to AI assistants. Unlike existing evaluations, we use prefix completion to bypass model safeguards. This leads the LLMs to generate suffixes that express hostility toward humans or actions with severe threat, such as the execution of a nuclear strike. Our experiments on 10 LLMs reveal that LLM-generated content indicates existential threats. To investigate the underlying causes, we also analyze the attention logits from LLMs. To highlight real-world safety risks, we further develop a framework to assess model behavior in tool-calling. We find that LLMs actively select and invoke external tools with existential threats.

When a tracker shuts down (whether by operator choice, technical failure, or legal action) users lose their contribution history and cannot prove their standing to new communities. We address these problems by storing reputation in smart contracts and replacing self-reports with cryptographic attestations. Receiving peers sign receipts for transferred pieces, which the tracker aggregates and verifies before updating on-chain reputation. Trackers run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to guarantee correct aggregation and prevent manipulation of state. If a tracker is unavailable, peers use an authenticated Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for discovery: the on-chain reputation acts as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), so peers can verify each other and maintain access control without the tracker. This design persists reputation across tracker failures and makes it portable to new instances through single-hop migration in factory-deployed contracts. We formalize the security requirements, prove correctness under standard cryptographic assumptions, and evaluate a prototype on Intel TDX. Measurements show that transfer receipts adds less than 6\\% overhead with typical piece sizes, and signature aggregation speeds up verification by $2.5\\times$.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17260v2\n    "}}

Thanks to photonic quantum interferometers of considerable size, experimental studies could be performed, devoted to investigating the consequences of different sorts of realistic noise in these systems. In this work we employ a 20x20 on-chip multimode interferometer to introduce another key aspect in the problem: the presence of edges in the walker lattice, enforcing a confined evolution. We show how noise can disrupt translational symmetry and reshape interference patterns. The non trivial probability distributions obtained along the temporal evolution of the system demonstrate how speed up effects, localization and coherent oscillations are pillar concepts to be fully characterized and understood when applied in realistic quantum dynamics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19125v1\n    "}}

A key prerequisite for such large-scale collaboration is agent capability discovery, where agents identify, advertise, and match one another's capabilities under dynamic tasks. Agent's capability in IoA is inherently heterogeneous and context-dependent, raising challenges in capability representation, scalable discovery, and long-term performance. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel two-stage capability discovery framework. The first stage, autonomous capability announcement, allows agents to credibly publish machine-interpretable descriptions of their abilities. The second stage, task-driven capability discovery, enables context-aware search, ranking, and composition to locate and assemble suitable agents for specific tasks. Building on this framework, we propose a novel scheme that integrates semantic capability modeling, scalable and updatable indexing, and memory-enhanced continual discovery. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach enhances discovery performance and scalability. Finally, we outline a research roadmap and highlight open problems and promising directions for future IoA.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19113v1\n    "}}

We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15082v3\n    "}}

However, the lack of large-scale, annotated datasets specific to privacy and trust has limited the ability of researchers to systematically analyze these concerns using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.\n  Objective: This study aims to develop and benchmark Health App Reviews for Privacy & Trust (HARPT), a large-scale annotated corpus of patient reviews from eHealth apps to advance research in patient privacy and trust.\n  Methods: We employed a multistage data construction strategy. This integrated keyword-based filtering, iterative manual labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using transformer-based classifiers. A curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support machine learning model development and evaluation. The resulting dataset was used to benchmark a broad range of models.\n  Results: The HARPT corpus comprises 480,000 patient reviews annotated across seven categories capturing critical aspects of trust in the application (TA), trust in the provider (TP), and privacy concerns (PC). We provide comprehensive benchmark performance for a range of machine learning models on the manually annotated subset, establishing a baseline for future research.\n  Conclusions: The HARPT corpus is a significant resource for advancing the study of privacy and trust in the eHealth domain. By providing a large-scale, annotated dataset and initial benchmarks, this work supports reproducible research in usable privacy and trust within health informatics. HARPT is released under an open resource license.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19268v4\n    "}}

This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we call for AI-oriented RTC research, exploring the network requirement shift from \"humans watching video\" to \"AI understanding video\". We begin by recognizing the main differences between AI Video Chat and traditional RTC. Then, through prototype measurements, we identify that ultra-low bitrate is a key factor for low latency. To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat.

In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to enhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This approach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant text, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise. These two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic information to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to dynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both taskrelevant semantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the legitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's performance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose an alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the encryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method achieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak signalto-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26610v2\n    "}}

They are nourished by collecting rich streams of data, raising privacy concerns around excessive collection of sensitive personal information. Privacy policies are the fundamental mechanism for informing users about data practices in modern information privacy paradigm. Although traditional web and mobile policies are well studied, the privacy policies of LLM providers, their LLM-specific content, and their evolution over time remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal empirical study of privacy policies for mainstream LLM providers worldwide. We curate a chronological dataset of 74 historical privacy policies and 115 supplemental privacy documents from 11 LLM providers across 5 countries up to August 2025, and extract over 3,000 sentence-level edits between consecutive policy versions. We compare LLM privacy policies to those of other software formats, propose a taxonomy tailored to LLM privacy policies, annotate policy edits and align them with a timeline of key LLM ecosystem events. Results show they are substantially longer, demand college-level reading ability, and remain highly vague. Our taxonomy analysis reveals patterns in how providers disclose LLM-specific practices and highlights regional disparities in coverage. Policy edits are concentrated in first-party data collection and international/specific-audience sections, and that product releases and regulatory actions are the primary drivers, shedding light on the status quo and the evolution of LLM privacy policies.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21758v1\n    "}}

However, the initial results obtained from ISAC systems are coarse and often unsatisfactory due to the high sparsity of the point clouds and significant noise variance. To address this problem, we propose a noise-sparsity-aware diffusion model (NSADM) post-processing framework. Leveraging the powerful data recovery capabilities of diffusion models, the proposed scheme exploits spatial features and the additive nature of noise to enhance point cloud density and denoise the initial input. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing model-based and deep learning-based approaches in terms of Chamfer distance and root mean square error.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19044v1\n    "}}

Such protocols constitute a model of distributed computations which are functorially presented and englobe message adversaries. We give a characterization of the solvability of colorless tasks against compact adversaries. Colorless tasks are an important class of distributed tasks, examples thereof including the ubiquitous agreement tasks. Therefore, our result is a significant step toward unifying topological methods in distributed computing.\n  The main insight of this work is in considering global states obtained after finite executions of a distributed protocol not as abstract simplicial complexes as was previously done, but as spectral spaces, considering the Alexandrov topology on the associated face posets. Given an adversary $\\mathcal{M}$ with a set of inputs $\\mathcal{I}$, we define a limit object $\u03a0^\\infty_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathcal{I})$ by a projective limit in the category of spectral spaces. This encodes all distributed information about the adversary, allowing us to derive a new distributed computability theorem using Stone duality: there exists an algorithm solving a colorless task $(\\mathcal{I},\\mathcal{O},\u0394)$ against the compact adversary $\\mathcal{M}$ if and only if there exists a spectral map $\u03a0^\\infty_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\mathcal{I})\\rightarrow\\mathcal{O}$ compatible with $\u0394$.\n  From this characterization, we derive the known colorless computability theorems for (colored or uncolored) Iterated Immediate Snapshot.

However, routing performance suffers due to dynamic topology changes, unpredictable contact patterns, and resource constraints including limited energy and buffer capacity. These challenges compromise delivery reliability, increase latency, and reduce node longevity in highly dynamic environments. This paper proposes Cluster-based Routing using Deep Reinforcement Learning (CR-DRL), an adaptive routing approach that integrates an Actor-Critic learning framework with a heuristic function. CR-DRL enables real-time optimal relay selection and dynamic cluster overlap adjustment to maintain connectivity while minimizing redundant transmissions and enhancing routing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. CR-DRL extends node lifetimes by up to 21%, overall energy use is reduced by 17%, and nodes remain active for 15% longer. Communication performance also improves, with up to 10% higher delivery ratio, 28.5% lower delay, 7% higher throughput, and data requiring 30% fewer transmission steps across the network.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19026v1\n    "}}

However, current alignment techniques rely on generic definitions of harm that fail to capture context-dependent violations, such as administrative fraud and clinical discrimination. To address this, we introduce Medical Malice: a dataset of 214,219 adversarial prompts calibrated to the regulatory and ethical complexities of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Crucially, the dataset includes the reasoning behind each violation, enabling models to internalize ethical boundaries rather than merely memorizing a fixed set of refusals. Using an unaligned agent (Grok-4) within a persona-driven pipeline, we synthesized high-fidelity threats across seven taxonomies, ranging from procurement manipulation and queue-jumping to obstetric violence. We discuss the ethical design of releasing these \"vulnerability signatures\" to correct the information asymmetry between malicious actors and AI developers. Ultimately, this work advocates for a shift from universal to context-aware safety, providing the necessary resources to immunize healthcare AI against the nuanced, systemic threats inherent to high-stakes medical environments -- vulnerabilities that represent the paramount risk to patient safety and the successful integration of AI in healthcare systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21757v1\n    "}}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated kernel generation, yet most existing systems rely solely on correctness or execution time feedback, lacking the ability to reason about low-level performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce PRAGMA, a profile-guided AI kernel generation framework that integrates execution feedback and fine-grained hardware profiling into the reasoning loop. PRAGMA enables LLMs to identify performance bottlenecks, preserve historical best versions, and iteratively refine code quality. We evaluate PRAGMA on KernelBench, covering GPU and CPU backends. Results show that PRAGMA consistently outperforms baseline AIKG without profiling enabled and achieves 2.81$\\times$ and 2.30$\\times$ averaged speedups against Torch on CPU and GPU platforms, respectively.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06345v2\n    "}}

Prior works have modeled this refusal mechanism as a single linear direction in the activation space. We posit that this is an oversimplification that conflates two functionally distinct neural processes: the detection of harm and the execution of a refusal. In this work, we deconstruct this single representation into a Harm Detection Direction and a Refusal Execution Direction. Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer. DBDI applies adaptive projection nullification to the refusal execution direction while suppressing the harm detection direction via direct steering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBDI outperforms prominent jailbreaking methods, achieving up to a 97.88\\% attack success rate on models such as Llama-2. By providing a more granular and mechanistic framework, our work offers a new direction for the in-depth understanding of LLM safety alignment.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06852v4\n    "}}

Per-record Differential Privacy (PrDP) addresses this by defining the privacy budget as a function of each record, offering better alignment with real-world needs. However, the dependency between the privacy budget and the data value introduces challenges in protecting the budget's privacy itself. Existing solutions either handle specific privacy functions or adopt relaxed PrDP definitions. A simple workaround is to use the global minimum of the privacy function, but this severely degrades utility, as the minimum is often set extremely low to account for rare records with high privacy needs. In this work, we propose a general and practical framework that enables any standard DP mechanism to support PrDP, with error depending only on the minimal privacy requirement among records actually present in the dataset. Since directly revealing this minimum may leak information, we introduce a core technique called privacy-specified domain partitioning, which ensures accurate estimation without compromising privacy. We also extend our framework to the local DP setting via a novel technique, privacy-specified query augmentation. Using our framework, we present the first PrDP solutions for fundamental tasks such as count, sum, and maximum estimation. Experimental results show that our mechanisms achieve high utility and significantly outperform existing Personalized DP (PDP) methods, which can be viewed as a special case of PrDP with relaxed privacy protection.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19015v1\n    "}}

To enhance LLM safety, various jailbreak defense methods have been proposed to guard against harmful outputs. However, improvements in model safety often come at the cost of severe over-refusal, failing to strike a good balance between safety and usability. In this paper, we first analyze the causes of over-refusal from a representation perspective, revealing that over-refusal samples reside at the boundary between benign and malicious samples. Based on this, we propose MOSR, designed to mitigate over-refusal by intervening the safety representation of LLMs. MOSR incorporates two novel components: (1) Overlap-Aware Loss Weighting, which determines the erasure weight for malicious samples by quantifying their similarity to pseudo-malicious samples in the representation space, and (2) Context-Aware Augmentation, which supplements the necessary context for rejection decisions by adding harmful prefixes before rejection responses. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in mitigating over-refusal while largely maintaining safety. Overall, we advocate that future defense methods should strike a better balance between safety and over-refusal.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19009v1\n    "}}

However, audit artifacts are heterogeneous and often lack reproducible, executable PoC tests suitable for automated validation, leading to costly, ad hoc manual verification. Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to turn audit reports into PoC test cases, but have three major challenges: noisy inputs, hallucinations, and missing runtime oracles. In this paper, we present SmartPoC, an automated framework that converts textual audit reports into executable, validated test cases. First, the input audit report is processed to reduce noise, and only bug-related functions are extracted and fed to LLMs as context. To curb hallucinations and ensure compile-and-run readiness, we leverage LLMs to synthesize PoC test cases with specially-designed pre-/post-execution repair. We further utilize differential verification as oracles to confirm exploitability of the PoC test cases. On the SmartBugs-Vul and FORGE-Vul benchmarks, SmartPoC generates executable, validated Foundry test cases for 85.61% and 86.45% of targets, respectively. Applied to the latest Etherscan verified-source corpus, SmartPoC confirms 236 real bugs out of 545 audit findings at a cost of only $0.03 per finding.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12993v2\n    "}}

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18969v1\n    "}}

We used ten different LLMs for code generation and analyzed the outputs through static analysis. The amount of CWEs present in AI-generated code is concerning.

The emergence of advanced large language models presents a promising yet largely unexplored opportunity to develop autonomous agents as inference attack experts, helping address this challenge. In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations. We anticipate that such agents could empower non-expert ML service providers, auditors, or regulators to systematically assess the risks of ML services without requiring deep domain expertise.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19536v1\n    "}}

This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we consider a scenario where experts are dispersed across an edge network for distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy, we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee. For the general case where $K \\geq 1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE layer introduces non-submodularity, which renders greedy methods ineffective. To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference latency compared to existing baselines.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06567v2\n    "}}

In most of these approaches, hardware extensions such as Intel SGX, TDX, AMD SEV, etc., are leveraged to provide encryption and integrity protection on process or VM level. Although all of these approaches increase the trust in the application at runtime, an often overlooked aspect is the integrity and confidentiality protection at build time, which is equally important as maliciously injected code during compilation can compromise the entire application and system. In this paper, we present Tical, a practical framework for trusted compilation that provides integrity protection and confidentiality in build pipelines from source code to the final executable. Our approach harnesses TEEs as runtime protection but enriches TEEs with file system shielding and an immutable audit log with version history to provide accountability. This way, we can ensure that the compiler chain can only access trusted files and intermediate output, such as object files produced by trusted processes. Our evaluation using micro- and macro-benchmarks shows that Tical can protect the confidentiality and integrity of whole CI/CD pipelines with an acceptable performance overhead.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17070v2\n    "}}

We investigate the interactions, and the collective impact, of the whole processing chain on the final secure key rate. This includes the quantum mechanical preprocessing in the form of entanglement distillation, processing of the entangled states via measurements and the necessary classical postprocessing based on the measurement results. Our investigations are based on the principle idea of the Eckert 1991 protocol and utilize the secret key capacity introduced by Devetak and Winter in 2005. Our results include a proof on what measurement bases need to be chosen to achieve this capacity for the case of Werner states. It also presents a new processing strategy and compares it with the most common one that can be found within the literature. Furthermore, it answers the question on how much entanglement distillation is optimal. By doing so we propose a unified formalism, describing the whole processing chain, that can be used to make quantitative statements on the relation between the quality and quantity of entangled but noisy quantum states used for generating secure keys.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18913v1\n    "}}

This creates a fundamental weakness: the most serious cyber threats often do not arise from what is known, but from what is assumed, overlooked, or not yet conceived, and frequently originate from the future, such as artificial intelligence, information warfare, and supply chain attacks, where adversaries continuously develop new exploits that can bypass defenses built on current knowledge. To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible. This enhances the predictability of adversary behavior, particularly under future uncertainty, helping security leaders make informed decisions today that shape more resilient security postures for the future.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16088v2\n    "}}

Cloud providers meet this demand through GPU-as-a-Service platforms that offer rentable GPU resources for running AI workloads. In this context, the sharing of GPU resources between different tenants is essential to maximize the number of scheduled workloads. Among the various GPU sharing technologies, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) stands out by partitioning GPUs at hardware level into isolated slices with dedicated compute and memory, ensuring strong tenant isolation, preventing resource contention, and enhancing security. Despite these advantages, MIG's fixed partitioning introduces scheduling rigidity, leading to severe GPU fragmentation in multi-tenant environments, where workloads are continuously deployed and terminated. Fragmentation leaves GPUs underutilized, limiting the number of workloads that can be accommodated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel scheduling framework for MIG-based clouds that maximizes workload acceptance while mitigating fragmentation in an online, workload-agnostic setting. We introduce a fragmentation metric to quantify resource inefficiency and guide allocation decisions. Building on this metric, our greedy scheduling algorithm selects GPUs and MIG slices that minimize fragmentation growth for each incoming workload. We evaluate our approach against multiple baseline strategies under diverse workload distributions. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher workload acceptance rates, leading to an average 10% increase in the number of scheduled workloads in heavy load conditions, while using approximately the same number of GPUs as the benchmark methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18906v1\n    "}}

Since Mysticeti-C is built over DAGs it also achieves high resource efficiency and censorship resistance. Mysticeti-C achieves this latency improvement by avoiding explicit certification of the DAG blocks and by proposing a novel commit rule such that every block can be committed without delays, resulting in optimal latency in the steady state and under crash failures. We further extend Mysticeti-C to Mysticeti-FPC, which incorporates a fast commit path that achieves even lower latency for transferring assets. Unlike prior fast commit path protocols, Mysticeti-FPC minimizes the number of signatures and messages by weaving the fast path transactions into the DAG. This frees up resources, which subsequently result in better performance. We prove the safety and liveness in a Byzantine context. We evaluate both Mysticeti protocols and compare them with state-of-the-art consensus and fast path protocols to demonstrate their low latency and resource efficiency, as well as their more graceful degradation under crash failures. Mysticeti-C is the first Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve WAN latency of 0.5s for consensus commit while simultaneously maintaining state-of-the-art throughput of over 200k TPS. Finally, we report on integrating Mysticeti-C as the consensus protocol into the Sui blockchain, resulting in over 4x latency reduction.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14821v6\n    "}}

While enabling rich functionalities like activity recognition and step counting, this openness has also enabled unregulated inference of sensitive user traits, such as gender, age, and even identity, without user consent. Existing privacy-preserving techniques, such as GAN-based obfuscation or differential privacy, typically require access to the full input sequence, introducing latency that is incompatible with real-time scenarios. Worse, they tend to distort temporal and semantic patterns, degrading the utility of the data for benign tasks like activity recognition. To address these limitations, we propose the Predictive Adversarial Transformation Network (PATN), a real-time privacy-preserving framework that leverages historical signals to generate adversarial perturbations proactively. The perturbations are applied immediately upon data acquisition, enabling continuous protection without disrupting application functionality. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PATN substantially degrades the performance of privacy inference models, achieving Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 40.11% and 44.65% (reducing inference accuracy to near-random) and increasing the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 8.30% and 7.56% to 41.65% and 46.22%.

Specifically, CIF reduces dynamic structural errors by enforcing linear consistency in the latent space, meanwhile reduces numerical integration errors by adaptively adjusting the integration order according to local trajectory stability. Experimental results show that our method reduces latent reconstruction error by more than 35\\% and achieves higher message extraction accuracy than existing approaches.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00434v2\n    "}}

Traditional federated learning often lacks personalization, as a single global model cannot capture client-specific characteristics, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, especially for clients with highly divergent data distributions.\n  To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization.\n  Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation improves personalization and robustness in heterogeneous environments without increasing communication cost.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18841v1\n    "}}

Despite these advancements, the security of VLM-based grounding systems has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper reveals a novel and realistic vulnerability: the first multi-target backdoor attack on VLM-based visual grounding. Unlike prior attacks that rely on static triggers or fixed targets, we propose IAG, a method that dynamically generates input-aware, text-guided triggers conditioned on any specified target object description to execute the attack. This is achieved through a text-conditioned UNet that embeds imperceptible target semantic cues into visual inputs while preserving normal grounding performance on benign samples. We further develop a joint training objective that balances language capability with perceptual reconstruction to ensure imperceptibility, effectiveness, and stealth. Extensive experiments on multiple VLMs (e.g., LLaVA, InternVL, Ferret) and benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, Flickr30k Entities, and ShowUI) demonstrate that IAG achieves the best ASRs compared with other baselines on almost all settings without compromising clean accuracy, maintaining robustness against existing defenses, and exhibiting transferability across datasets and models. These findings underscore critical security risks in grounding-capable VLMs and highlight the need for further research on trustworthy multimodal understanding.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09456v3\n    "}}

We present EAGER, an edge-aligned defense framework that integrates parameter-efficient quantization with domain-specific preference alignment to jointly optimize efficiency, robustness, and accuracy. Unlike prior methods that address these aspects separately, EAGER leverages Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) for low-cost fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a self-constructed cybersecurity preference dataset, eliminating the need for human labels. Experiments show that EAGER reduces adversarial attack success rates by up to 7.3x and improves QA accuracy by up to 55% over state-of-the-art defenses, while achieving the lowest response latency on a Jetson Orin, demonstrating its practical edge deployment.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19523v1\n    "}}

However, existing systems are limited by insufficient functionality support and inefficient implementations for training GRMs in industrial scenarios. As such, we introduce MTGenRec as an efficient and scalable system for GRM training. Specifically, to handle real-time insertions/deletions of sparse embeddings, MTGenRec employs dynamic hash tables to replace static ones. To improve training efficiency, MTGenRec conducts dynamic sequence balancing to address the computation load imbalances among GPUs and adopts feature ID deduplication alongside automatic table merging to accelerate embedding lookup. Extensive experiments show that MTGenRec improves training throughput by $1.6\\times -- 2.4\\times$ while achieving good scalability when running over 100 GPUs. MTGenRec has been deployed for many applications in Meituan and is now handling hundreds of millions of requests on a daily basis.

Sharing only model updates generated from local training on client data with the server enhances user data privacy. However, model performance may suffer due to data and system heterogeneity among clients in FL scenarios. Previous studies have proposed model optimization, fine-tuning, and personalization to achieve improved model performance. Despite these efforts, models resulting from FL scenarios often exhibit catastrophic forgetting, which increases the communication and computational costs of clients for model optimization and raises energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a reference model-based fine-tuning method for federated learning that overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. Our method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning and includes an proximal term. It employs a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters and reviews previous global features in the model optimization step to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. As a result, our method achieves higher model performance and lower communication and computational costs for clients than existing methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23210v4\n    "}}

However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10505v2\n    "}}

This paper presents RoguePrompt, an automated jailbreak attack that converts a disallowed user query into a self reconstructing prompt which passes provider moderation while preserving the original harmful intent. RoguePrompt partitions the instruction across two lexical streams, applies nested classical ciphers, and wraps the result in natural language directives that cause the target model to decode and execute the hidden payload. Our attack assumes only black box access to the model and to the associated moderation endpoint. We instantiate RoguePrompt against GPT 4o and evaluate it on 2 448 prompts that a production moderation system previously marked as strongly rejected. Under an evaluation protocol that separates three security relevant outcomes bypass, reconstruction, and execution the attack attains 84.7 percent bypass, 80.2 percent reconstruction, and 71.5 percent full execution, substantially outperforming five automated jailbreak baselines. We further analyze the behavior of several automated and human aligned evaluators and show that dual layer lexical transformations remain effective even when detectors rely on semantic similarity or learned safety rubrics. Our results highlight systematic blind spots in current moderation practice and suggest that robust deployment will require joint reasoning about user intent, decoding workflows, and model side computation rather than surface level toxicity alone.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18790v1\n    "}}

However, the long transmission distance and adverse environments from IoT satellites to ground devices pose a huge challenge to link reliability, as evidenced by the measurement results based on our real-world setup. In this paper, we propose a blind coherent combining design named B2LoRa to boost LoRa transmission performance. The intuition behind B2LoRa is to leverage the repeated broadcasting mechanism inherent in satellite-IoT systems to achieve coherent combining under the low-power and low-cost constraints, where each re-transmission at different times is regarded as the same packet transmitted from different antenna elements within an antenna array. Then, the problem is translated into aligning these packets at a fine granularity despite the time, frequency, and phase offsets between packets in the case of frequent packet loss. To overcome this challenge, we present three designs - joint packet sniffing, frequency shift alignment, and phase drift mitigation to deal with ultra-low SNRs and Doppler shifts featured in satellite-IoT systems, respectively. Finally, experiment results based on our real-world deployments demonstrate the high efficiency of B2LoRa.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24140v2\n    "}}

To protect these assets in the deployed environment, recent research has proposed model usage control mechanisms to ensure models cannot be used without proper authorization. These methods typically lock the utility of the model by embedding an access key into its parameters. However, they often assume static deployment, and largely fail to withstand continual post-deployment model updates, such as fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose ADALOC, to endow key-based model usage control with adaptability during model evolution. It strategically selects a subset of weights as an intrinsic access key, which enables all model updates to be confined to this key throughout the evolution lifecycle. ADALOC enables using the access key to restore the keyed model to the latest authorized states without redistributing the entire network (i.e., adaptation), and frees the model owner from full re-keying after each model update (i.e., lock preservation). We establish a formal foundation to underpin ADALOC, providing crucial bounds such as the errors introduced by updates restricted to the access key. Experiments on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Flowers-102, and modern architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, demonstrate that ADALOC achieves high accuracy under significant updates while retaining robust protections. Specifically, authorized usages consistently achieve strong task-specific performance, while unauthorized usage accuracy drops to near-random guessing levels (e.g., 1.01% on CIFAR-100), compared to up to 87.01% without ADALOC. This shows that ADALOC can offer a practical solution for adaptive and protected DNN deployment in evolving real-world scenarios.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18772v1\n    "}}

Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15289v5\n    "}}

While machine learning-based intrusion detection has been widely explored, such methods have not demonstrated detection and mitigation within the required real-time budget. In contrast, cryptographic authentication has emerged as a practical candidate for real-time cyber defense, as specified in IEC 62351. In addition, lightweight rule-based intrusion detection that validates IEC 61850 semantics can provide specification-based detection of anomalous or malicious traffic with minimal processing delay. This paper presents the design logic and implementation aspects of three potential real-time mitigation techniques capable of countering GOOSE-based attacks: (i) IEC 62351-compliant message authentication code (MAC) scheme, (ii) a semantics-enforced rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS), and (iii) a hybrid approach integrating both MAC verification and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). A comparative evaluation of these real-time mitigation approaches is conducted using a cyber-physical system (CPS) security testbed. The results show that the hybrid integration significantly enhances mitigation capability. Furthermore, the processing delays of all three methods remain within the strict delivery requirements of GOOSE communication. The study also identifies limitations that none of the techniques can fully address, highlighting areas for future work.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18748v1\n    "}}

However, this integration also introduces distinct safety and security challenges. In this paper, we unify the concepts of safety and security in the context of MFMs by identifying critical threats that arise from both model behavior and system-level interactions. We propose a taxonomy grounded in information theory, evaluating risks through the concepts of channel capacity, signal, noise, and bandwidth. This perspective provides a principled way to analyze how information flows through MFMs and how vulnerabilities can emerge across modalities. Building on this foundation, we introduce a deterministic minimax formulation to analyze defense mechanisms and expose structural vulnerabilities in multimodal systems. Our framework projects attacks onto the noise, signal, and bandwidth axes, collapsing the defense search space and mitigating defender asymmetry. Across 15 defenses, we find that system-level bandwidth and behavior constraints generalize substantially better than brittle model-only methods. Finally, we formalize an MFM \"self-destruction threshold\" that specifies when termination should be triggered, providing a concrete activation rule for circuit-breaker safeguards within multimodal systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11195v5\n    "}}

However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18723v1\n    "}}

Meanwhile, the Computing Power Network (CPN) aims to integrate global computing resources and perform on-demand scheduling to efficiently handle services from diverse sources. However, it is limited by static deployment and limited adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the complementary relationship between LAE and CPN and propose a novel air-ground collaborative intelligent service provision with an agentification paradigm. Through synergy between LAE and CPNs, computing and communication services are jointly scheduled and collaboratively optimized to enhance the execution efficiency of low-altitude services and improve the flexibility of CPNs. It also integrates LAE's strengths in aerial sensing, mobile coverage, and dynamic communication links, forming a cloud-edge-air collaborative framework. Hence, we review the characteristics and limitations of both LAE and CPN and explore how they can cooperate to overcome these limitations. Then we demonstrate the flexibility of the integrated CPN and LAE framework through a case study. Finally, we summarize the key challenges in constructing an integrated air-ground computing and communication system and discuss future research directions toward emerging technologies.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18720v1\n    "}}

We focus on the CM case in this memoir, and show how to realize the following two goals:\n  (1) to give an unconditional estimate for $\u03c0_{E,r}(x)$, which confirms the upper bound part of the conjecture up to a constant multiple;\n  (2) to give a conditional explicit asymptotic formula for $\u03c0_{E,r}(x)$ based on the Hardy--Littlewood conjecture on primes represented by quadratic polynomials.\n  For completeness, we also summarize classical results on quadratic, cubic and quartic residues, as well as the corresponding reciprocity laws. This part should be of independent interests and could provide useful materials for more junior readers.

Current AI systems operate on opaque data structures that lack the audit trails, provenance tracking, or explainability required by emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. We propose an artifact-centric AI agent paradigm where behavior is driven by persistent, verifiable data artifacts rather than ephemeral tasks, solving the trustworthiness problem at the data architecture level. Central to this approach is the Multimodal Artifact File Format (MAIF), an AI-native container embedding semantic representations, cryptographic provenance, and granular access controls. MAIF transforms data from passive storage into active trust enforcement, making every AI operation inherently auditable. Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity. Advanced security features include stream-level access control, real-time tamper detection, and behavioral anomaly analysis with minimal overhead. This approach directly addresses the regulatory, security, and accountability challenges preventing AI deployment in sensitive domains, offering a viable path toward trustworthy AI systems at scale.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15097v2\n    "}}

However, their complex reasoning processes introduce new and largely unexplored security vulnerabilities. We present DarkMind, a novel latent reasoning level backdoor attack that targets customized LLMs by manipulating internal COT steps without altering user queries. Unlike prior prompt based attacks, DarkMind activates covertly within the reasoning chain via latent triggers, enabling adversarial behaviors without modifying input prompts or requiring access to model parameters. To achieve stealth and reliability, we propose dual trigger types instant and retrospective and integrate them within a unified embedding template that governs trigger dependent activation, employ a stealth optimization algorithm to minimize semantic drift, and introduce an automated conversation starter for covert activation across domains. Comprehensive experiments on eight reasoning datasets spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic domains, using five LLMs, demonstrate that DarkMind consistently achieves high attack success rates. We further investigate defense strategies to mitigate these risks and reveal that reasoning level backdoors represent a significant yet underexplored threat, underscoring the need for robust, reasoning aware security mechanisms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18617v2\n    "}}

Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These \"one-shot\" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.\n  We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.\n  We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than na\u00efve search strategies. Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18653v1\n    "}}

In 2024, Starlink, in partnership with T-Mobile, began beta testing an SMS-only Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) service. This marks the first large-scale deployment of Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, allowing unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations. This paper presents the first measurement study of deployed DS2D technologies. Using crowdsourced mobile network data from the U.S. between October 2024 and July 2025, we provide evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and future evolution of DS2D technologies for extending mobile connectivity. We find a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed, the number of unique cell identifiers measured, and the volume of measurements, concentrated in accessible areas with poor terrestrial network coverage, such as national parks and sparsely populated counties. Stable physical-layer measurements were observed throughout the period, with a 24-dB lower median RSRP and a 3-dB higher RSRQ compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on the SINR measurements collected, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 3 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 18 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory and business decisions, including allowable out-of-band emissions, permitted number of satellites, and availability of spectrum and orbital resources.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00283v8\n    "}}

However, sequential split learning suffers from poor scalability, while parallel variants like parallel split learning and split federated learning often incur high server resource overhead due to model duplication and aggregation, and generally exhibit reduced model performance and convergence owing to factors like client drift and lag. To address these limitations, we introduce CycleSL, a novel aggregation-free split learning framework that enhances scalability and performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods. Inspired by alternating block coordinate descent, CycleSL treats server-side training as an independent higher-level machine learning task, resampling client-extracted features (smashed data) to mitigate heterogeneity and drift. It then performs cyclical updates, namely optimizing the server model first, followed by client updates using the updated server for gradient computation. We integrate CycleSL into previous algorithms and benchmark them on five publicly available datasets with non-iid data distribution and partial client attendance. Our empirical findings highlight the effectiveness of CycleSL in enhancing model performance.

With the rise of AI-generated bug reports, little work exists to help bug hunters understand why these reports are labeled as invalid. To improve report quality and reduce reviewers' burden, it is critical to predict invalid reports and interpret invalid reasons.\n  In this work, we conduct an empirical study with the purpose of helping bug hunters understand the validity of reports. We collect a dataset of 9,942 disclosed bug bounty reports, including 1,400 invalid reports, and evaluate whether state-of-the-art large language models can identify invalid reports. While models such as GPT-5, DeepSeek, and a fine-tuned RoBERTa achieve strong overall accuracy, they consistently struggle to detect invalid cases, showing a tendency to over-accept reports. To improve invalidity detection, we build a taxonomy of rejection reasons for Information Disclosure vulnerabilities and incorporate it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. This approach substantially improves classification consistency and reduces bias. We also examine whether reviewer decisions may be influenced by factors beyond the content of the report. Our analysis shows that reporters with higher reputations tend to receive more favorable outcomes in borderline cases, suggesting that perceived expertise can influence review judgments.\n  Overall, our findings highlight the challenges of invalid report identification and show that combining LLMs with structured reviewer knowledge can support more transparent and consistent vulnerability report review.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18608v1\n    "}}

However, integrating Digital Twins into 6G environments presents challenges in maintaining consistent network services under adverse conditions such as including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, while ensuring consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In this work, we present a Digital Twin Platform to facilitate bidirectional communication between User Equipment (UEs) and application-specific digital twins to enhance UE traffic under UDP flood attacks. By leveraging AI to analyze key digital twin parameters such as throughput and delay, our framework derives actionable insights that enhance QoS management in DoS attack scenarios, ultimately advancing real-world applications of digital twins in critical infrastructure domains. The performance of this Digital Twin Platform is validated through an emergency management use-case in 6G networks while the network is under attack with UDP flood attacks in terms of packet reception success rate, average packet delay, and average throughput metrics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18577v1\n    "}}

The advent of fifth-generation and beyond cellular networks (B5G) introduces emerging compute capabilities into the Radio Access Network (RAN), transforming it from a traditionally closed, vendor-locked infrastructure into an open and programmable ecosystem. This evolution, exemplified by Open-RAN (O-RAN), enables the deployment of control-plane applications from diverse sources, which can dynamically influence user-plane traffic in response to real-time events. As cellular infrastructures become more disaggregated and software-driven, security becomes an increasingly critical concern. Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a promising security paradigm that discards implicit trust assumptions by acknowledging that threats may arise from both external and internal sources. ZTA mandates comprehensive and fine-grained security mechanisms across both control and user planes to contain adversarial movements and enhance breach detection and attack response actions. In this paper, we explore the adoption of ZTA in the context of 5G and beyond, with a particular focus on O-RAN as an architectural enabler. We analyze how ZTA principles align with the architectural and operational characteristics of O-RAN, and identify key challenges and opportunities for embedding zero-trust mechanisms within O-RAN-based cellular networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18568v1\n    "}}

These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \\textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Tri}archy \\textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the \"fake\" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19499v1\n    "}}

In this paper, we propose DEXO, a decentralized data exchange mechanism that facilitates secure and fair data exchange between data consumers and distributed IoT/mobile data providers at scale, allowing the consumer to verify the data generation process and the providers to be compensated for providing authentic data, with correctness guarantees from the exchange platform. To realize this, DEXO extends the decentralized oracle network model that has been successful in the blockchain applications domain to incorporate novel hardware-cryptographic co-design that harmonizes trusted execution environment, secret sharing, and smart contract-assisted fair exchange. For the first time, DEXO ensures end-to-end data confidentiality, source verifiability, and fairness of the exchange process with strong resilience against participant collusion. We implemented a prototype of the DEXO system to demonstrate feasibility. The evaluation shows a moderate deployment cost and significantly improved blockchain operation efficiency compared to a popular data exchange mechanism.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18498v1\n    "}}

We present a hierarchical dual-strategy framework for selective knowledge unlearning that precisely removes specialized knowledge while preserving fundamental medical competencies. Our approach synergistically integrates geometric-constrained gradient updates to selectively modulate target parameters with concept-aware token-level interventions that distinguish between preservation-critical and unlearning-targeted tokens via a unified four-level medical concept hierarchy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MedMCQA (surgical) and MHQA (anxiety, depression, trauma) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving an 82.7% forgetting rate and 88.5% knowledge preservation. Notably, our framework maintains robust privacy guarantees while requiring modification of only 0.1% of parameters, addressing critical needs for regulatory compliance, auditability, and ethical standards in clinical research.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19498v1\n    "}}

It achieves extended transmission by spreading symbols over multiple samples, with redundancy controlled by the Spreading Factor (SF), and further error resilience provided by Forward Error Correction (FEC). However, practical limits on SF and the separation between signal-level demodulation and coding-level error correction in conventional LoRa PHY leave it vulnerable under extremely weak signals - common in city-scale deployments. To address this, we present SFusion, a software-based coding framework that jointly leverages signal-level aggregation and coding-level redundancy to enhance LoRa's robustness. When signals fall below the decodable threshold, SFusion encodes a quasi-SF(k +m) symbol using 2^m SFk symbols to boost processing gain through energy accumulation. Once partial decoding becomes feasible with energy aggregation, an opportunistic decoding strategy directly combines IQ signals across symbols to recover errors. Extensive evaluations show that SFusion achieves up to 15dB gain over SF12 and up to 13dB improvement over state-of-the-art solutions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18484v1\n    "}}

While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18467v1\n    "}}

To better understand carbon emissions at the edge, we analyze granular carbon intensity traces at intermediate \"mesoscales,\" such as within a single US state or among neighboring countries in Europe, and observe significant variations in carbon intensity at these spatial scales. Importantly, our analysis shows that carbon intensity variations, which are known to occur at large continental scales (e.g., cloud regions), also occur at much finer spatial scales, making it feasible to exploit geographic workload shifting in the edge computing context. Motivated by these findings, we propose \\proposedsystem, a carbon-aware framework for edge computing that optimizes the placement of edge workloads across mesoscale edge data centers to reduce carbon emissions while meeting latency SLOs. We implement CarbonEdge and evaluate it on a real edge computing testbed and through large-scale simulations for multiple edge workloads and settings. Our experimental results on a real testbed demonstrate that CarbonEdge can reduce emissions by up to 78.7\\% for a regional edge deployment in central Europe. Moreover, our CDN-scale experiments show potential savings of 49.5\\% and 67.8\\% in the US and Europe, respectively, while limiting the one-way latency increase to less than 5.5 ms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14076v2\n    "}}

It enables cars to offload computationally intensive tasks to nearby servers. Effective offloading involves determining when to offload tasks, selecting the appropriate MEC site, and efficiently allocating resources to ensure good performance. Car mobility poses significant challenges to guaranteeing reliable task completion, and today we still lack energy efficient solutions to this problem, especially when considering real-world car mobility traces. In this paper, we begin by examining the mobility patterns of cars using data obtained from a leading mobile network operator in Europe. Based on the insights from this analysis, we design an optimization problem for task computation and offloading, considering both static and mobility scenarios. Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption at the cars and at the MEC nodes while satisfying the latency requirements of various tasks. We evaluate our solution, based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, both in simulations and in a realistic setup that relies on datasets from the operator. Our solution shows a significant reduction of user dissatisfaction and task interruptions in both static and mobile scenarios, while achieving energy savings of 47 percent in the static case and 14 percent in the mobile case compared to state-of-the-art schemes.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18449v1\n    "}}

The rollout phase, which dominates end-to-end iteration time, suffers from substantial long-tail latency and poor resource utilization due to inherent workload imbalance. We present Seer, a novel online context learning system that addresses these challenges by exploiting previously overlooked similarities in output lengths and generation patterns among requests sharing the same prompt. Seer introduces three key techniques: divided rollout for dynamic load balancing, context-aware scheduling, and adaptive grouped speculative decoding. Together, these mechanisms substantially reduce long-tail latency and improve resource efficiency during rollout. Evaluations on production-grade RL workloads demonstrate that Seer improves end-to-end rollout throughput by 74% to 97% and reduces long-tail latency by 75% to 93% compared to state-of-the-art synchronous RL systems, significantly accelerating RL training iterations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14617v2\n    "}}

However, when applied to large-scale firmware, their performance degrades due to the binary nature of firmware, complex dependency structures, and heterogeneous components. To address this challenge, this paper presents FIRMHIVE, a recursive agent hive that enables LLMs to act as autonomous firmware security analysts. FIRMHIVE introduces two key mechanisms: (1) transforming delegation into a per-agent, executable primitive and (2) constructing a runtime Tree of Agents (ToA) for decentralized coordination. We evaluate FIRMHIVE using real-world firmware images obtained from publicly available datasets, covering five representative security analysis tasks. Compared with existing LLM-agent baselines, FIRMHIVE performs deeper (about 16x more reasoning steps) and broader (about 2.3x more files inspected) cross-file exploration, resulting in about 5.6x more alerts per firmware. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) security tools, FIRMHIVE identifies about 1.5x more vulnerabilities (1,802 total) and achieves 71% precision, representing significant improvements in both yield and fidelity.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18438v1\n    "}}

It is safe to say that Attestation-Based Attribute-Based Decentralized IDM (ABABDIDM) has not received anywhere near the same level of attention in the literature as general Attribute-Based DIDMs (ABDIDM), i.e, decentralized Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). The use of decentralization, i.e., DIDM, is to improve upon the security and privacy-related issues of centralized Identity Management Systems (IDM) and Attribute-Based IDMs (ABIDM). And blockchain is the framework used for decentralization in all these schemes. Many DIDMs - even ABDIDMs - have been defined on popular blockchains such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. However, despite the characteristics of Ripple that makes it appealing for an ABIDM, there is a lack of research to develop an Identity Management System (IDMS) on Ripple in literature. We have attempted to conceptualize an ABABDIDM on Ripple.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10545v2\n    "}}

The proposed PUF generates device-specific responses by measuring the pull-up and pull-down resistor values on the I/O pins of the ICs, which naturally vary across chips due to manufacturing-induced process variations. Since these resistors are already integrated into the I/O structures of most ICs, ioPUF+ requires no custom circuitry, and no new IC fabrication. This makes ioPUF+ suitable for cost-sensitive embedded systems built from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Beyond introducing a new PUF, ioPUF+ includes a complete datapath for converting raw PUF responses into cryptographically usable secret keys using BCH error correction and SHA-256 hashing. Further ioPUF+ also demonstrate a practical use case of PUF derive secret keys in securing device-to-device communication using AES-encryption. We implemented ioPUF+ on the Infineon PSoC-5 microcontroller and evaluated its performance across 30 devices using standard PUF metrics. The results show excellent reliability (intra-device Hamming distance of 100.00%), strong uniqueness (inter-device Hamming distance of 50.33%), near-ideal uniformity (50.54%), and negligible bit aliasing. Stability tests under temperature and supply-voltage variations show worst-case bit-error rates of only 2.63% and 2.10%, respectively. We also profiled the resource and energy usage of the complete ioPUF+ system, including the PUF primitive, BCH decoding, SHA-256 hashing, and AES encryption. The full implementation requires only 19.8 KB of Flash, exhibits a latency of 600 ms, and consumes 79 mW of power, demonstrating the suitabilitiy of ioPUF+ for resource-constrained IoT nodes.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18412v1\n    "}}

Operating in a decentralized manner, SSI enables the verification of claims, including privacy-preserving mechanisms. Blockchain, which can be used to implement a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), is often considered one of the pillars of SSI, along with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Unfortunately, blockchains are mostly siloed, affecting the interoperability and universality of SSI. We investigate the effect of blockchain isolation on blockchain-based SSI. We first define possible scenarios for cross-chain SSI and exemplify with real-life use cases. We then define specific requirements for cross-chain SSI and identify challenges, also in relation to the identified scenarios. We explore various solutions to achieve blockchain interoperability, with a focus on SSI. In particular, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of distinct cross-chain models for cross-chain SSI. Finally, we address the usability of cross-chain SSI and discuss security and privacy aspects, opening the way for future research.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18379v1\n    "}}

LLMs increasingly act as intermediaries between humans and web information. Yet the web remains optimized for human browsing rather than AI-driven semantic retrieval, resulting in wasted network bandwidth, lower information quality, and unnecessary complexity for developers. We introduce the concept of an AI-Native Internet, a web architecture in which servers expose semantically relevant information chunks rather than full documents, supported by a Web-native semantic resolver that allows AI applications to discover relevant information sources before retrieving fine-grained chunks. Through motivational experiments, we quantify the inefficiencies of current HTML-based retrieval, and outline architectural directions and open challenges for evolving today's document-centric web into an AI-oriented substrate that better supports semantic access to web content.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18354v1\n    "}}

In this regime it becomes feasible to implement random-codebook error correction, which is known to perform close to capacity. We propose a reverse reconciliation scheme for CVQKD in which the first step is advantage distillation based on random-codebook error correction operated above the Shannon limit. Our scheme has a novel way of achieving statistical decoupling between the public reconciliation data and the secret key. We provide an analysis of the secret key rate for the case of Gaussian collective attacks, and we present numerical results. The best performance is obtained when the message size exceeds the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ between Alice's quadratures $X$ and Bob's measurements $Y$, i.e. the Shannon limit. This somewhat counter-intuitive result is understood from a tradeoff between code rate and frame rejection rate, combined with the fact that error correction for QKD needs to reconcile only random data. We obtain secret key rates that lie far above the Devetak-Winter value $I(X;Y) - I(E;Y)$, which is the upper bound in the case of one-way error correction. Furthermore, our key rates lie above the PLOB bound for Continuous-Variable detection, but below the PLOB bound for Discrete-Variable detection.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04770v3\n    "}}

However, the individual experts may be privacy-sensitive in that the learnt policy may retain information about their precise choices. In some domains like personalized retrieval, advertising and healthcare, the expert choices are considered sensitive data. To provably protect the privacy of such experts, we propose a novel consensus-based expert-level differentially private offline RL training approach compatible with any existing offline RL algorithm. We prove rigorous differential privacy guarantees, while maintaining strong empirical performance. Unlike existing work in differentially private RL, we supplement the theory with proof-of-concept experiments on classic RL environments featuring large continuous state spaces, demonstrating substantial improvements over a natural baseline across multiple tasks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13598v2\n    "}}

Quantum mutual information (QMI), a fundamental nonlocal measure, plays a key role in quantifying entanglement and has become increasingly important in studying nonequilibrium quantum many-body phenomena, such as many-body localization and thermalization. However, experimental measurement of QMI remains extremely difficult, particularly for nonequilibrium states, which are more complex than ground states. In this Letter, we employ a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to establish a universal mapping between the QMI and local correlations only up to second order for nonequilibrium states generated by quenches in a one-dimensional disordered XXZ model. Our approach provides a practical method for experimentally extracting QMI, readily applicable in platforms such as superconducting qubits. Moreover, this work will establishes a general framework for reconstructing other nonlocal observables, including Fisher information and out-of-time-ordered correlators.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18327v1\n    "}}

This problem comes with an added constraint, i.e., of \\emph{monotonicity}, in which whenever a node or an edge is decontaminated, it must not get recontaminated. Hence, the name comes \\emph{monotone decontamination}. This problem has been relatively explored in static graphs, but nothing is known yet in dynamic graphs. We, in this paper, study the \\emph{monotone decontamination} problem in arbitrary dynamic graphs. We designed two models of dynamicity, based on the time within which a disappeared edge must reappear. In each of these two models, we proposed lower bounds as well as upper bounds on the number of agents, required to fully decontaminate the underlying dynamic graph, monotonically. Our results also highlight the difficulties faced due to the sudden disappearance or reappearance of edges. Our aim in this paper has been to primarily optimize the number of agents required to solve monotone decontamination in these dynamic networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18315v1\n    "}}

In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight-binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\u0394$, on-site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that together define the underlying random graph structure. By varying $p$, $\u0394$, and the disorder strength, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show a strong competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations across parameter regimes. Notably, even in the presence of strong disorder, skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson-driven localization. We further discuss the relevance of these results to machine-learning architectures and information propagation in complex networks and other real-world problems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10156v2\n    "}}

While alternating the LoRA matrices has been shown to stabilize aggregation in centralized FL, extending this mechanism to decentralized, peer-to-peer communication introduces new challenges due to phase-state mismatch and block-wise divergence across clients. We introduce ADF-LoRA, which synchronizes the update of only one low-rank matrix per round and mixes both matrices to maintain more consistent parameter states under decentralized propagation. This design preserves the cross-term suppression effect of alternating updates while improving stability in serverless topologies. We provide a convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions and evaluate ADF-LoRA on multiple GLUE tasks. Experiments show that ADF-LoRA achieves faster and smoother convergence and delivers the highest average accuracy across tasks, outperforming existing LoRA variants in decentralized FL by a consistent margin.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18291v1\n    "}}

This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18272v1\n    "}}

Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\\% with 95\\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08637v2\n    "}}

Investigating Black-Box Model Inversion Attacks in Spiking Neural Networks\n    summary: As machine learning models become integral to security-sensitive applications, concerns over data leakage from adversarial attacks continue to rise. Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by enabling adversaries to reconstruct training data from model outputs. While MI attacks on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely studied, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) remain largely unexplored in this context. Due to their event-driven and discrete computations, SNNs introduce fundamental differences in information processing that may offer inherent resistance to such attacks. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this threat lies in black-box settings, where attackers operate through queries without direct access to model parameters or gradients-representing a more realistic adversarial scenario in deployed systems. This work presents the first study of black-box MI attacks on SNNs. We adapt a generative adversarial MI framework to the spiking domain by incorporating rate-based encoding for input transformation and decoding mechanisms for output interpretation. Our results show that SNNs exhibit significantly greater resistance to MI attacks than ANNs, as demonstrated by degraded reconstructions, increased instability in attack convergence, and overall reduced attack effectiveness across multiple evaluation metrics. Further analysis suggests that the discrete and temporally distributed nature of SNN decision boundaries disrupts surrogate modeling, limiting the attacker's ability to approximate the target model.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05509v2\n    "}}

This security stems from their modeling as Haar-random unitaries. However, implementing such unitaries on Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices is challenging due to exponential simulation complexity. Previous work tackled this using pseudo-random unitary designs but only under limited adversarial models with only black-box query access.\n  In this paper, we propose a new QPUF construction based on chaotic quantum dynamics. We modeled the QPUF as a unitary time evolution under a chaotic Hamiltonian and proved that this approach offers security comparable to Haar-random unitaries. Intuitively, we show that while chaotic dynamics generate less randomness than ideal Haar unitaries, the randomness is still sufficient to make the QPUF unclonable in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that the evolution time required to achieve security scales linearly with number of qudits used in the scheme and can be kept public.\n  We identified the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model as a candidate for the QPUF Hamiltonian. Recent experiments using nuclear spins and cold atoms have shown progress toward achieving this goal. Inspired by recent experimental advances, we present a schematic architecture for realizing our proposed QPUF device based on optical Kagome Lattice with disorder. For adversaries with only query access, we also introduce an efficiently simulable pseudo-chaotic QPUF. Our results lay the preliminary groundwork for bridging the gap between theoretical security and the practical implementation of QPUFs for the first time.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01004v2\n    "}}

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) face significant limitations, including poor adaptability to evolving and zero-day attacks, reliance on static signatures and labeled datasets, and inefficiency on resource-constrained edge gateways. Moreover, most existing DRL-based IDS studies overlook sustainability factors such as energy efficiency and carbon impact. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS: DeepEdgeIDS, an unsupervised Autoencoder-DRL hybrid, and AutoDRL-IDS, a supervised LSTM-DRL model. Both DRL-based IDS are validated through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on edge gateways. Results demonstrate that AutoDRL-IDS achieves 94% detection accuracy using labeled data, while DeepEdgeIDS attains 98% accuracy and adaptability without labels. Distinctly, this study introduces a carbon-aware, multi-objective reward function optimized for sustainable and real-time IDS operations in dynamic IoT networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18240v1\n    "}}

Conventional anomaly detection schemes often prioritize accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency and environmental impact, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained edge environments. This paper presents \\textit{EcoDefender}, a sustainable hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates \\textit{Autoencoder(AE)}-based representation learning with \\textit{Isolation Forest(IF)} anomaly scoring. Beyond empirical performance, EcoDefender is supported by a theoretical foundation that establishes formal guarantees for its stability, convergence, robustness, and energy-complexity coupling-thereby linking computational behavior to energy efficiency. Furthermore, experiments on realistic IoT traffic confirm these theoretical insights, achieving up to 94\\% detection accuracy with an average CPU usage of only 22\\%, 27 ms inference latency, and 30\\% lower energy consumption compared to AE-only baselines. By embedding sustainability metrics directly into the security evaluation process, this work demonstrates that reliable anomaly detection and environmental responsibility can coexist within next-generation green IoT infrastructures, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 9: resilient infrastructure, SDG 13: climate action).\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18235v1\n    "}}

This paper presents an edge-centric Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework that integrates lightweight machine learning (ML) based IDS models with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to improve detection accuracy, semantic interpretability, and operational efficiency at the network edge. The system evaluates six ML-based IDS models: Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model on low-power edge gateways, achieving accuracy up to 98 percent under real-world cyberattacks. For anomaly detection, the system transmits a compact and secure telemetry snapshot (for example, CPU usage, memory usage, latency, and energy consumption) via low-bandwidth API calls to LLMs including GPT-4-turbo, DeepSeek V2, and LLaMA 3.5. These models use zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought reasoning to produce human-readable threat analyses and actionable mitigation recommendations. Evaluations across diverse attacks such as DoS, DDoS, brute force, and port scanning show that the system enhances interpretability while maintaining low latency (<1.5 s), minimal bandwidth usage (<1.2 kB per prompt), and energy efficiency (<75 J), demonstrating its practicality and scalability as an IDS solution for edge gateways.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18230v1\n    "}}

It is observed that these matrices often have circulant structure. The basic idea of this work is to utilize the property to construct a sequence of transformation matrices, which allows subsequent heuristic algorithms to find more efficient implementations. Our results outperform previous works for various linear layers of block ciphers. For Whirlwind M0 , we obtain two implementations with 159 XOR counts (8% better than Yuan et al. at FSE 2025) and depth 17 (39% better than Shi et al. at AsiaCrypt 2024) respectively. For AES MixColumn, our automated method produces a quantum circuit with depth 10, which nearly matches the manually optimized state-of-the-art result by Zhang et al. at IEEE TC 2024, only with 2 extra CNOTs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18226v1\n    "}}

Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS, have shown promise due to their adaptive and generalization capabilities. However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18223v1\n    "}}

Here, we demonstrate the deterministic coupling of an ultracold atomic lattice to light propagating in suspended on-chip photonic circuits. These capabilities open avenues to address scalability challenges in neutral-atom quantum computers and simulators, enabling fast optical readout, efficient and subwavelength non-diffracting interaction zones, and genuine compatibility with integrated solid-state photon sources, detectors, and stop-band modulators. Beyond controllable quantum matter, the platform also enables in-situ imaging of evanescent fields of light and nanoscale structures, including prospects for three-dimensional scanning microscopy with non-invasive single-atom probes for quantum sensing applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18211v1\n    "}}

Regev's recent high-dimensional variant reduces the circuit size through lattice-based post-processing, but introduces substantial space overhead and lacks practical implementations. Here, we propose a qubit reuse method by intermediate-uncomputation that significantly reduces the space complexity of Regev's algorithm, inspired by reversible computing. Our basic strategy lowers the cost from \\( O(n^{3/2}) \\) to \\( O(n^{5/4}) \\), and refined strategies achieve \\( O(n \\log n) \\)which is a space lower bound within this model. Simulations demonstrate the resulting time-space trade-offs and resource scaling. Moreover, we construct and compile quantum circuits that factor \\( N = 35 \\), verifying the effectiveness of our method through noisy simulations. A more simplified experimental circuit for Regev's algorithm is executed on a superconducting quantum computer, with lattice-based post-processing successfully retrieving the factors. These results advance the practical feasibility of Regev-style quantum factoring and provide guidance for future theoretical and experimental developments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18198v1\n    "}}

In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\u00e9nyi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06251v2\n    "}}

We show that recent state-of-the-art methods regarding tensors and BP, like block belief propagation and tensor network message passing, are special instances of our framework. From a practical perspective, we discuss how our framework can be useful to understand the benefits of scheduling in BP, and show how it can be used for decoding purposes in quantum error correction. We simulate the computation of marginals, internal energy, Shannon entropy and the partition function on synthetic topologies (Kagome lattice and lattices resembling quantum error-correcting codes) and a real world topology of a power grid. The results show orders of magnitude accuracy increases for modest computational overheads. For the marginals, for example, we show that our framework can achieve an accuracy improvement of more than six orders of magnitude over tensor network BP.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04957v3\n    "}}

Recent approaches that attempt to reduce this overhead either suffer from low representation ability, mode collapse issues, or require the effort of collecting data at all target locations. We present LocaGen, a novel spatial augmentation framework that significantly reduces fingerprinting overhead by generating high-quality synthetic data at completely unseen locations. LocaGen leverages a conditional diffusion model guided by a novel spatially aware optimization strategy to synthesize realistic fingerprints at unseen locations using only a subset of seen locations. To further improve our diffusion model performance, LocaGen augments seen location data based on domain-specific heuristics and strategically selects the seen and unseen locations using a novel density-based approach that ensures robust coverage. Our extensive evaluation on a real-world WiFi fingerprinting dataset shows that LocaGen maintains the same localization accuracy even with 30% of the locations unseen and achieves up to 28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art augmentation methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18158v1\n    "}}

However, strict isolation and maintaining runtime security in these environments has become increasingly challenging. Existing approaches like seccomp and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) frameworks offer some protection up to a limit, but often lack context awareness, syscall argument filtering, and adaptive enforcement, providing the ability to adjust decisions at runtime based on observed application behavior, workload changes, or detected anomalies rather than relying solely on static or predefined rules.This paper introduces eBPF-PATROL (eBPF-Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation), an extensible lightweight runtime security agent that uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to monitor and enforce policies in containerized and virtualized environments. By intercepting system calls, analyzing execution context, and applying user-defined rules, eBPF-PATROL detects and prevents real-time boundary violations, such as reverse shells, privilege escalation, and container escape attempts. We describe the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of eBPF-PATROL, demonstrating its low overhead (< 2.5 percent) and high detection accuracy across real-world attack scenarios.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18155v1\n    "}}

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution \"context stream\" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity \"insight stream\" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18151v1\n    "}}

In this work, we present a federated learning framework built to run efficiently across mixed HPC and cloud environments.

Through experiments on a hybrid testbed, we demonstrate strong performance in terms of scalability, fault tolerance, and convergence, even under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data distributions and varied hardware.

However, their effectiveness in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for vulnerability detection (VD), they suffer from data leakage, limited scope, and superficial analysis, hindering the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper begins by revisiting the common issues in existing research on PLMs for VD through the evaluation pipeline. It then proceeds with an accurate and extensive evaluation of 18 PLMs on high-quality datasets that feature accurate labeling, diverse vulnerability types, and various projects. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness to a series of perturbations.\n  Our findings reveal that PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios, such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies, handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a non-negligible number of labeling errors, which is overlooked by previous work. This study underscores the importance of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for realistic VD applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16887v3\n    "}}

However, the interdependencies among modalities increase the susceptibility of multimodal models to adversarial attacks. Existing methods mainly focus on attacks on specific modalities or indiscriminately attack all modalities. In this paper, we find that these approaches ignore the differences between modalities in their contribution to final robustness, resulting in suboptimal robustness performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training (VARMAT), a probe-in-training adversarial training method that improves multimodal robustness by identifying the vulnerability of each modality. To be specific, VARMAT first explicitly quantifies the vulnerability of each modality, grounded in a first-order approximation of the attack objective (Probe). Then, we propose a targeted regularization term that penalizes modalities with high vulnerability, guiding robust learning while maintaining task accuracy (Training). We demonstrate the enhanced robustness of our method across multiple multimodal datasets involving diverse modalities. Finally, we achieve {12.73%, 22.21%, 11.19%} robustness improvement on three multimodal datasets, revealing a significant blind spot in multimodal adversarial training.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18138v1\n    "}}

While these models offer cost advantages, they introduce volatility and uncertainty that are not fully addressed by current allocation algorithms or simulation tools. This work contributes to the modeling and evaluation of such environments by extending the CloudSim Plus simulation framework to support realistic spot instance lifecycle management, including interruption, termination, hibernation, and reallocation. The enhanced simulator is validated using synthetic scenarios and large-scale simulations based on the Google Cluster Trace dataset. Building on this foundation, the HLEM-VMP allocation algorithm, originally proposed in earlier research, was adapted to operate under dynamic spot market conditions. Its performance was evaluated against baseline allocation strategies to assess its efficiency and resilience in volatile workload environments. The comparison demonstrated a reduction in the number of spot instance interruptions as well as a decrease in the maximum interruption duration. Overall, this work provides both a simulation framework for simulating dynamic cloud behavior and analytical insights into virtual machine allocation performance and market risk, contributing to more robust and cost-effective resource management in cloud computing.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18137v1\n    "}}

Situations such as job start-ups, checkpoint storms, or heavily skewed namespace access can trigger thousands of concurrent metadata requests against a small subset of servers. The result is long queues, inflated tail latencies, and reduced system throughput. Prior efforts including static namespace partitioning, backend-specific extensions, and kernel-level modifications address parts of the problem, but they often prove too rigid, intrusive to deploy, or unstable under shifting workloads. We present MIDAS, an adaptive middleware layer that operates transparently between clients and metadata servers, requiring no changes to kernels or storage backends. The design brings together three mechanisms: (i) a namespace-aware load balancer that enhances consistent hashing with power-of-d sampling informed by live telemetry, (ii) a cooperative caching layer that preserves backend semantics through leases, invalidations, or adaptive timeouts, and (iii) a self-stabilizing control loop that dynamically adjusts routing aggressiveness and cache lifetimes while avoiding oscillations under bursty workloads. Analysis of the model and controlled experiments show that MIDAS reduces average queue lengths by roughly 23% and mitigates worst-case hotspots by up to 80% when compared to round-robin scheduling. These findings highlight that a stability-aware, middleware-based strategy can provide backend-agnostic improvements to metadata management, enabling better scalability in bursty scenarios, more predictable tail latencies, and stronger overall system performance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18124v1\n    "}}

In contrast to classical zero-intelligence or Poisson based queueing models, the proposed framework introduces mathematically defined migration events between neighbouring price levels, whose intensities are themselves governed by the underlying Hawkes structure. This provides a principled stochastic mechanism for modeling interactions between order arrivals, cancellations, and liquidity movement across adjacent queues.\n  Starting from a microscopic specification of Hawkes driven order flow, we derive a diffusion approximation which yields a reflected mesoscopic stochastic differential equation (SDE) system for queue volumes. The limiting generator is obtained through a Taylor expansion of the microscopic generator, demonstrating how temporal excitation together with spatial migration determine the drift and diffusion structure of the limit order book in the mesoscopic regime. The resulting model extends existing diffusion limits by incorporating correlated excitations and price level to price level liquidity movement within a unified Hawkes based formulation.\n  By establishing this diffusive limit, the paper provides a mathematically consistent bridge between high frequency event based models and macroscopic stochastic descriptions of market microstructure. The work is entirely theoretical and lays a foundation for future analytical and numerical developments without relying on empirical calibration.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18117v1\n    "}}

Unlike traditional software, AI agents leverage LLMs as their \"brain\" to autonomously perform actions via connected tools. This capability introduces significant risks that go far beyond those of harmful text presented in a chatbot that was the main application of LLMs. A compromised AI agent can deliberately abuse powerful tools to perform malicious actions, in many cases irreversible, and limited solely by the guardrails on the tools themselves and the LLM ability to enforce them. This paper presents ASTRA, a first-of-its-kind framework designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting the creation of secure agents that enforce custom guardrails defined at the system-prompt level (e.g., \"Do not send an email out of the company domain,\" or \"Never extend the robotic arm in more than 2 meters\").\n  Our holistic framework simulates 10 diverse autonomous agents varying between a coding assistant and a delivery drone equipped with 37 unique tools. We test these agents against a suite of novel attacks developed specifically for agentic threats, inspired by the OWASP Top 10 but adapted to challenge the ability of the LLM for policy enforcement during multi-turn planning and execution of strict tool activation. By evaluating 13 open-source, tool-calling LLMs, we uncovered surprising and significant differences in their ability to remain secure and keep operating within their boundaries. The purpose of this work is to provide the community with a robust and unified methodology to build and validate better LLMs, ultimately pushing for more secure and reliable agentic AI systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18114v1\n    "}}

In realistic enterprise settings, this involves executing multi-host network attacks spanning many \"stepping stone\" hosts. Unfortunately, red teams are expensive and entail significant expertise and effort. Given the promise of LLMs in CTF challenges, we first analyze if LLMs can autonomously execute multi-host red team exercises. We find that state-of-the-art LLM-assisted offense systems (e.g., PentestGPT, CyberSecEval3) with leading LLMs (e.g., Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) are unable to do so.\n  Building on our observations in understanding the failure modes of state-of-the-art systems, we argue the need to improve the abstractions and interfaces for LLM-assisted red teaming. Based on this insight, we present the design and implementation of Incalmo, an LLM-assisted system for autonomously red teaming multi-host networks. Incalmo uses LLMs to plan red team exercises in terms of high-level declarative tasks that are executed by domain-specific task agents. Incalmo also uses auxiliary services to manage context and acquired assets.\n  For our evaluation, we develop MHBench, a novel multi-host attack benchmark with 40 realistic emulated networks (from 22 to 50 hosts). We find that Incalmo successfully acquires critical assets (i.e., key hosts or data) in 37 out of 40 MHBench environments. In contrast, state-of-the-art LLM-assisted systems succeed in only 3 out of 40 environments. We show that Incalmo is efficient-successful attacks took 12-54 minutes and cost <$15 in LLM credits.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16466v4\n    "}}

However, as engineers typically create these procedures manually, the generated configuration procedures frequently diverge from the specified requirements. To improve this situation, this paper proposes a method for automatically generating configuration procedures consisting of network device configuration commands based on network configurations and their modification specifications. In this study, we employed the UML (Unified Modeling Language) object-oriented modeling language to develop a notation for network configuration modeling that ensures both strict specification adherence and ease of extension. Additionally, we implemented a method for automatically generating configuration procedures that match the specifications by utilizing network configuration models. As an evaluation experiment, we applied the proposed method to a configuration change scenario in a wide-area campus network at Shinshu University, where the network was migrated from static routing to dynamic routing using the OSPF protocol. As a result, all expected configuration procedures were obtained and a network exhibiting the intended behavior was successfully constructed.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18100v1\n    "}}

While ABAC provides fine-grained, context-aware access management, the increasing number and complexity of access policies can make their formulation and evaluation rather challenging. To address the task of synthesizing concise yet accurate policies, we evaluate the performance of some of the state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically Google Gemini (Flash and Pro) and OpenAI ChatGPT, as potential policy mining engines. An experimental framework was developed in Python to generate randomized access data parameterized by varying numbers of subjects, objects, and initial policy sets. The baseline policy sets, which govern permission decisions between subjects and objects, serve as the ground truth for comparison. Each LLM-generated policy was evaluated against the baseline policy using standard performance metrics. The results indicate that LLMs can effectively infer compact and valid ABAC policies for small-scale scenarios. However, as the system size increases, characterized by higher numbers of subjects and objects, LLM outputs exhibit declining accuracy and precision, coupled with significant increase in the size of policy generated, which is beyond the optimal size. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLM architectures for scalable policy mining in access control domains. Future work will explore hybrid approaches that combine prompt optimization with classical rule mining algorithms to improve scalability and interpretability in complex ABAC environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18098v1\n    "}}

However, their reliance on wireless links makes them vulnerable to jamming, which can disrupt coordination and mission success. This work investigates whether a UAV swarm can effectively overcome jamming while maintaining communication and mission efficiency.\n  To address this, a unified optimization framework combining Genetic Algorithms (GA), Supervised Learning (SL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed. The mission model, structured into epochs and timeslots, allows dynamic path planning, antenna orientation, and swarm formation while progressively enforcing collision rules. Null-steering antennas enhance resilience by directing antenna nulls toward interference sources.\n  Results show that the GA achieved stable, collision-free trajectories but with high computational cost. SL models replicated GA-based configurations but struggled to generalize under dynamic or constrained settings. RL, trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), demonstrated adaptability and real-time decision-making with consistent communication and lower computational demand. Additionally, the Adaptive Movement Model generalized UAV motion to arbitrary directions through a rotation-based mechanism, validating the scalability of the proposed system.\n  Overall, UAV swarms equipped with null-steering antennas and guided by intelligent optimization algorithms effectively mitigate jamming while maintaining communication stability, formation cohesion, and collision safety. The proposed framework establishes a unified, flexible, and reproducible basis for future research on resilient swarm communication systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18086v1\n    "}}

We present DeepQMap, a deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Dynamic Noise Adaptation (DNA) network with multi-head attention mechanisms and Rainbow DQN architecture. Unlike conventional static optimization approaches such as QUBO formulations, our method continuously adapts to hardware dynamics through learned temporal representations of quantum system behavior. Comprehensive evaluation across 270 benchmark circuits spanning Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover's algorithm, and Variational Quantum Eigensolver demonstrates that DeepQMap achieves mean circuit fidelity of $0.920 \\pm 0.023$, representing a statistically significant 49.3\\% improvement over state-of-the-art QUBO methods ($0.618 \\pm 0.031$, $t_{98} = 4.87$, $p = 0.0023$, Cohen's $d = 2.34$). Inter-chip communication overhead reduces by 79.8\\%, decreasing from 2.34 operations per circuit to 0.47. The DNA network maintains noise prediction accuracy with coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.912$ and mean absolute error of 0.87\\%, enabling proactive compensation for hardware fluctuations. Scalability analysis confirms sustained performance across 20-100 qubit systems, with fidelity remaining above 0.87 even at maximum scale where competing methods degrade below 0.60. Training convergence occurs 8.2$\\times$ faster than baseline approaches, completing in 45 minutes versus 370 minutes for QUBO optimization.

Despite the proliferation of IoT security guidelines, a unified and quantitative approach to measuring trust remains absent. This paper introduces SCI-IoT (Secure Certification Index for IoT), a standardized and quantitative framework for trust scoring, evaluation, and certification of IoT devices.\n  The framework employs a six-tier grading model (Grades A-F), enabling device profiling across consumer, industrial, and critical infrastructure domains. Within this model, 30 distinct Trust Tests assess devices across dimensions such as authentication, encryption, data integrity, resilience, and firmware security. Each test is assigned a criticality-based weight (1.0-2.0) and a performance rating (1-4), converted to a normalized percentage and aggregated through a weighted computation to yield the Secure Certification Index (SCI). The SCI determines the device's Trust Verdict, categorized into five SCI levels, and serves as the foundation for optional grade-based certification. The framework also incorporates critical gate conditions, enforcing absolute compliance in high risk parameters to prevent certification of devices with fundamental vulnerabilities.

Existing privacy attacks on RAG systems can trigger data leakage but often fail to accurately isolate knowledge-base-derived sentences within mixed responses. They also lack robustness when applied across multiple domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel black-box attack framework that exploits knowledge asymmetry between RAG and standard LLMs to achieve fine-grained privacy extraction across heterogeneous knowledge landscapes. We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that creates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content. Specifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information disparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and syntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature scores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike prior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative refinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we achieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in multi-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in case studies. This work bridges the gap between attack and defense in RAG systems, enabling precise extraction of private information while providing a foundation for adaptive mitigation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23229v2\n    "}}

Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18025v1\n    "}}

While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17989v1\n    "}}

Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17982v1\n    "}}

Existing forecasting techniques are limited by the lack of combined robust anomaly mitigation solutions and data privacy preservation. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel anomaly-resilient federated learning framework that simultaneously preserves data privacy, detects cyber-attacks, and maintains trustworthy demand prediction accuracy under adversarial conditions. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: LSTM autoencoder-based distributed anomaly detection deployed at each federated client, interpolation-based anomalous data mitigation to preserve temporal continuity, and federated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that enable collaborative learning without centralized data aggregation. The framework is validated on real-world EV charging infrastructure datasets combined with real-world DDoS attack datasets, providing robust validation of the proposed approach under realistic threat scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated approach achieves superior performance compared to centralized models, with 15.2% improvement in R2 accuracy while maintaining data locality. The integrated cyber-attack detection and mitigation system produces trustworthy datasets that enhance prediction reliability, recovering 47.9% of attack-induced performance degradation while maintaining exceptional precision (91.3%) and minimal false positive rates (1.21%). The proposed architecture enables enhanced EV infrastructure planning, privacy-preserving collaborative forecasting, cybersecurity resilience, and rapid recovery from malicious threats across distributed charging networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17978v1\n    "}}

The state of practice is to have _natural language_ specifications, from which test cases are derived manually - a process that is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale. _Formal_ specifications, on the other hand, are well-suited for automated test generation, but are tedious to write and maintain. In this work, we propose a two-stage pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap: First, we extract _protocol elements_ from natural-language specifications; second, leveraging a protocol implementation, we synthesize and refine a formal _protocol specification_ from these elements, which we can then use to massively test further implementations.\n  We see this two-stage approach to be superior to end-to-end LLM-based test generation, as 1. it produces an _inspectable specification_ that preserves traceability to the original text; 2. the generation of actual test cases _no longer requires an LLM_; 3. the resulting formal specs are _human-readable_, and can be reviewed, version-controlled, and incrementally refined; and 4. over time, we can build a _corpus_ of natural-language-to-formal-specification mappings that can be used to further train and refine LLMs for more automatic translations.\n  Our prototype, AUTOSPEC, successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our approach on five widely used _internet protocols_ (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP, and ManageSieve) by applying its methods on their _RFC specifications_ written in natural-language, and the recent _I/O grammar_ formalism for protocol specification and fuzzing. In its evaluation, AUTOSPEC recovers on average 92.8% of client and 80.2% of server message types, and achieves 81.5% message acceptance across diverse, real-world systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17977v1\n    "}}

Most approaches assume non-anomalous measurements, make predictions with unquantified uncertainties, and do not mitigate malicious attacks on renewable forecasts for energy management optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive cyber-resilient framework integrating federated Long Short-Term Memory-based photovoltaic forecasting with a novel two-stage cascade false data injection attack detection and energy management system optimization. The approach combines autoencoder reconstruction error with prediction uncertainty quantification to enable attack-resilient energy storage scheduling while preserving data privacy. Extreme false data attack conditions were studied that caused 58% forecast degradation and 16.9\\% operational cost increases. The proposed integrated framework reduced false positive detections by 70%, recovered 93.7% of forecasting performance losses, and achieved 5\\% operational cost savings, mitigating 34.7% of attack-induced economic losses. Results demonstrate that precision-focused cascade detection with multi-signal fusion outperforms single-signal approaches, validating security-performance synergy for decentralized microgrids.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17968v1\n    "}}

We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions. We find that even without using permission history, our model achieves an accuracy of 66.9%, and a slight increase of training samples (i.e., 1-4) can substantially increase the accuracy by 10.8%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17959v1\n    "}}

We encode relational tables as a sequence of Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) over mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), transmit a bounded number of quantum states, and let a single, destructive measurement reconstruct only the selected tuple. This allows us to preserve data privacy and user privacy at once without trusted hardware or heavyweight cryptography. Moreover, we envision a novel hybrid quantum-classical architecture ready for early deployment, which ensures compatibility with the limitations of today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19055v3\n    "}}

However, the interactions between devices based on network protocols can be complex, making this assessment challenging. Meanwhile, testing with actual devices incurs significant costs and effort for procurement and preparation. Traditional methods, however, have limitations in identifying configuration values that cause policy violations and verifying syntactically incomplete device configuration files. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically verify the consistency of a model representing the network configuration (Network Configuration Model) by static analysis. The proposed method performs verification based on the network configuration model to detect policy violations and points out configuration values that cause these violations. Additionally, to facilitate the designers' review of each network device's configuration, the model is converted into a format that mimics the output of actual devices, which designers are likely familiar with. As a case study, we applied the proposed method to the network configuration of Shinshu University, a large-scale campus network, by intentionally introducing configuration errors and applying the method. We further evaluated whether it could output device states equivalent to those of actual devices.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17950v1\n    "}}

Since testing on actual equipment is expensive and burdensome for engineers, we have proposed automatic verification methods using simulators and consistency verification methods for a network configuration model. Combining these methods with conventional verification methods for network device configurations will increase the number of verification options that do not require actual devices. However, the burden of writing existing networks into models has been a problem in our model-based verification. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically extracting a network device configuration model by parsing the contents obtained from network devices via show running-config commands and the like. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in realizing round-trip engineering between network device configurations and the network device configuration model, we extracted a model from existing network device configurations and generated device configuration commands. As a result, we obtained model and commands with high accuracy, indicating that the proposed method is effective.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17948v1\n    "}}

While standard Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols secure message content, they are not designed to protect the act of communication itself, leaving agents vulnerable to surveillance and traffic analysis. We find that the rich, event-driven nature of agent dialogues provides a powerful, yet untapped, medium for covert communication. To harness this potential, we introduce and formalize the Covert Event Channel, the first unified model for agent covert communication driven by three interconnected dimensions, which consist of the Storage, Timing,and Behavioral channels. Based on this model, we design and engineer \u03a0CCAP, a novel protocol that operationalizes this event-driven paradigm. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that \u03a0CCAP achieves high capacity and robustness while remaining imperceptible to powerful LLM-based wardens, establishing its practical viability. By systematically engineering this channel, our work provides the foundational understanding essential for developing the next generation of monitoring systems and defensive protocols for a secure and trustworthy IoA.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02188v3\n    "}}

Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to maintain high accuracy across both frequent and rare attacks, leading to increased false negatives for minority classes. To address this, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates specialized deep learning models with an ensemble meta-classifier. Each model is trained to detect a specific attack category, enabling tailored learning of class-specific patterns, while their collective outputs are fused by a Random Forest meta-classifier to improve overall decision reliability. The framework is evaluated on the NSL-KDD benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in handling class imbalance compared to conventional monolithic models. Results show significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score across all attack categories, including rare classes such as User to Root (U2R). The proposed system achieves near-perfect detection rates with minimal false alarms, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. This work advances the design of intrusion detection systems by combining specialization with ensemble learning, providing an effective and scalable solution for safeguarding modern networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12455v2\n    "}}

As a case study, we focus on the $\u03c4^+\u03c4^-$ system and the decay channel $\u03c4\\to \u03c0\u03bd$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10673v2\n    "}}

While Tor encrypts traffic and hides IP addresses, it remains vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks such as the website fingerprinting (WF) attack, achieving increasingly high fingerprinting accuracy even under open-world conditions. In response, researchers have proposed a variety of defenses, ranging from adaptive padding, traffic regularization, and traffic morphing to adversarial perturbation, that seek to obfuscate or reshape traffic traces. However, these defenses often entail trade-offs between privacy, usability, and system performance. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive survey unifying WF datasets, attack methodologies, and defense strategies remains absent. This paper fills that gap by systematically categorizing existing WF research into three key domains: datasets, attack models, and defense mechanisms. We provide an in-depth comparative analysis of techniques, highlight their strengths and limitations under diverse threat models, and discuss emerging challenges such as multi-tab browsing and coarse-grained traffic features. By consolidating prior work and identifying open research directions, this survey serves as a foundation for advancing stronger privacy protection in Tor.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11804v3\n    "}}

However, conventional RTA methods struggle with the state-space explosion problem, especially in non-preemptive systems with release jitter and execution time variations. In this paper, we introduce SAGkit, a Python toolkit that implements the schedule-abstraction graph (SAG) framework. SAGkit novelly enables exact and sustainable RTA of hybrid-triggered jobs by allowing job absence on the SAG basis. Our experiments demonstrate that SAGkit achieves exactness with acceptable runtime and memory overhead. This lightweight toolkit empowers researchers to analyze complex distributed control systems and is open-access for further development.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17882v1\n    "}}

While the increasing prevalence of LLM-powered applications provides users with unprecedented convenience, it also brings forth new security challenges. For such an emerging ecosystem, the security community lacks sufficient understanding of the LLM application ecosystem, especially regarding the capability boundaries of the applications themselves.\n  In this paper, we systematically analyzed the new development paradigm and defined the concept of the LLM app capability space. We also uncovered potential new risks beyond jailbreak that arise from ambiguous capability boundaries in real-world scenarios, namely, capability downgrade and upgrade. To evaluate the impact of these risks, we designed and implemented an LLM app capability evaluation framework, LLMApp-Eval. First, we collected application metadata across 4 platforms and conducted a cross-platform ecosystem analysis. Then, we evaluated the risks for 199 popular applications among 4 platforms and 6 open-source LLMs. We identified that 178 (89.45%) potentially affected applications, which can perform tasks from more than 15 scenarios or be malicious. We even found 17 applications in our study that executed malicious tasks directly, without applying any adversarial rewriting. Furthermore, our experiments also reveal a positive correlation between the quality of prompt design and application robustness. We found that well-designed prompts enhance security, while poorly designed ones can facilitate abuse. We hope our work inspires the community to focus on the real-world risks of LLM applications and foster the development of a more robust LLM application ecosystem.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17874v1\n    "}}

Academic institutions and researchers are high-value targets, facing dynamic, multilingual, and context-dependent threats that leverage research backgrounds, academic collaborations, and personal information to craft highly tailored attacks. Existing security benchmarks largely rely on datasets that do not incorporate specific academic background information, making them inadequate for capturing the evolving attack patterns and human-centric vulnerability factors specific to academia.

The Sun is by far the largest energy source in our solar system, and thus it warrants consideration how future AI infrastructure could most efficiently tap into that power. This work explores a scalable compute system for machine learning in space, using fleets of satellites equipped with solar arrays, inter-satellite links using free-space optics, and Google tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator chips. To facilitate high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite communication, the satellites would be flown in close proximity. We illustrate the basic approach to formation flight via a 81-satellite cluster of 1 km radius, and describe an approach for using high-precision ML-based models to control large-scale constellations. Trillium TPUs are radiation tested. They survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures, and are characterized for bit-flip errors. Launch costs are a critical part of overall system cost; a learning curve analysis suggests launch to low-Earth orbit (LEO) may reach $\\lesssim$\\$200/kg by the mid-2030s.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19468v1\n    "}}

Unlike other frameworks, it leverages group equivariant convolutional networks, which are known to increase the expressive capacity of a neural network by allowing the model to generalize to further classes of symmetries, such as rotations and reflections, without the need for data augmentation or data pre-processing. The results of this work are twofold. First, we show that typical UNet-based convolutional models can be easily extended to support group equivariant convolution (g-conv). Secondly, we show that the task of pathloss estimation benefits from such an extension, as the proposed extended model outperforms typical UNet-based models by up to 0.41 dB for a similar number of parameters in the RadioMapSeer dataset.

However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00154v4\n    "}}

However, fixing security bugs in the Linux kernel could be incomplete due to human mistakes. Specifically, an incomplete fix fails to repair all the original security defects in the software, fails to properly repair the original security defects, or introduces new ones. In this paper, we study the fixes of incomplete security bugs in the Linux kernel for the first time, and reveal their characteristics, root causes, as well as detection. We first construct a dataset of incomplete security bug fixes in the Linux kernel and answer the following three questions. What are the characteristics of incomplete security bug fixes in the Linux kernel? What are the root causes behind them? How should they be detected to reduce security risks? We then have the three main insights in the following. (*Due to the notification of arXiv \"The Abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters\", the appeared Abstract is shortened.

Although compiler and Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions have been introduced to address elements of this issue, the overhead and/or comprehensive applicability have limited broad production deployment. The Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to the ARM AArch64 Instruction Set Architecture is a valuable tool to address memory-safety escapes; when used in synchronous tag-checking mode, MTE provides deterministic detection and prevention of sequential buffer overflow attacks, and probabilistic detection and prevention of exploits resulting from temporal use-after-free pointer programming bugs. The AmpereOne processor, launched in 2024, is the first datacenter processor to support MTE. Its optimized MTE implementation uniquely incurs no memory capacity overhead for tag storage and provides synchronous tag-checking with single-digit performance impact across a broad range of datacenter class workloads. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the complete hardware-software stack, identifying application memory management as the primary remaining source of overhead and highlighting clear opportunities for software optimization. The combination of an efficient hardware foundation and a clear path for software improvement makes the MTE implementation of the AmpereOne processor highly attractive for deployment in production cloud environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17773v1\n    "}}

Existing benchmarks rely on synthetic datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) or scripted replay frameworks, which fail to capture adaptive adversary behavior. Even MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations, while influential, are host-centric and assume malware-driven compromise, thereby under-representing stealthy, multi-stage intrusions across IT and OT domains. We present StealthCup, a novel evaluation methodology that operationalizes IDS benchmarking as an evasion-focused Capture-the-Flag competition. Professional penetration testers engaged in multi-stage attack chains on a realistic IT/OT testbed, with scoring penalizing IDS detections. The event generated structured attacker writeups, validated detections, and PCAPs, host logs, and alerts. Our results reveal that out of 32 exercised attack techniques, 11 were not detected by any IDS configuration. Open-source systems (Wazuh, Suricata) produced high false-positive rates >90%, while commercial tools generated fewer false positives but also missed more attacks. Comparison with the Volt Typhoon APT advisory confirmed strong realism: all 28 applicable techniques were exercised, 19 appeared in writeups, and 9 in forensic traces. These findings demonstrate that StealthCup elicits attacker behavior closely aligned with state-sponsored TTPs, while exposing blind spots across both open-source and commercial IDS. The resulting datasets and methodology provide a reproducible foundation for future stealth-focused IDS evaluation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17761v1\n    "}}

We refute this core claim, theoretically proving that gradient-based attacks effectively target the DM rather than the classifier, causing DBP's outputs to align with adversarial distributions. This prompts a reassessment of DBP's robustness, accrediting it two critical factors: inaccurate gradients and improper evaluation protocols that test only a single random purification of the AE. We show that when accounting for stochasticity and resubmission risk, DBP collapses. To support this, we introduce DiffBreak, the first reliable toolkit for differentiation through DBP, eliminating gradient mismatches that previously further inflated robustness estimates. We also analyze the current defense scheme used for DBP where classification relies on a single purification, pinpointing its inherent invalidity. We provide a statistically grounded majority-vote (MV) alternative that aggregates predictions across multiple purified copies, showing partial but meaningful robustness gain. We then propose a novel adaptation of an optimization method against deepfake watermarking, crafting systemic perturbations that defeat DBP even under MV, challenging DBP's viability.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16598v4\n    "}}

In this work, we present the first nonperturbative study of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED2), within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory. Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17752v1\n    "}}

These resources are typically managed and controlled by aggregators that coordinate many resources to provide flexibility services. However, these aggregators and flexible energy resources are vulnerable, which could allow attackers to remotely control flexible energy resources to launch large-scale attacks on the grid. This paper investigates and evaluates the potential attack strategies that can be used to manipulate flexible energy resources to challenge the effectiveness of traditional grid stability measures and disrupt the first-swing stability of the power grid. Our work shows that although a large amount of power is required, the current flexibility capacities could potentially be sufficient to disrupt the grid on a national level.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17748v1\n    "}}

While traditional replication-based methods have been used for failure-resilient model serving in the cloud, such methods are often infeasible in edge environments due to significant resource constraints that preclude full replication. To address this problem, this paper presents FailLite, a failure-resilient model serving system that employs (i) a heterogeneous replication where failover models are smaller variants of the original model, (ii) an intelligent approach that uses warm replicas to ensure quick failover for critical applications while using cold replicas, and (iii) progressive failover to provide low mean time to recovery (MTTR) for the remaining applications. We implement a full prototype of our system and demonstrate its efficacy on an experimental edge testbed. Our results using 27 models show that FailLite can recover all failed applications with 175.5ms MTTR and only a 0.6% reduction in accuracy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15856v2\n    "}}

When multipath protocols like MPTCP and MPQUIC greedily exploit this diversity, uncoordinated migration can induce persistent, high-amplitude load oscillations. Although this instability is well-known, its quantitative performance impact remains poorly understood.\n  In this paper, we apply a discrete-time axiomatic framework to the joint dynamics of loss-based congestion control and greedy path selection. By deriving the system's dynamic equilibria (stable periodic oscillations), we prove a fundamental trade-off: high Responsiveness improves Fairness but necessarily degrades Efficiency and Convergence. Conversely, we demonstrate that Efficiency, Convergence, and Loss Avoidance are simultaneously achievable at a critical lossless operating point. Furthermore, we find that while migration de-synchronizes traffic in high-diversity environments, realistic limited-visibility constraints transform coherent oscillations into persistent spatial load imbalance, rather than eliminating instability entirely. These results yield concrete design guidelines for robust multipath transport over the future path-aware Internet.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26060v2\n    "}}

These attacks, called Meltdown and Spectre, exploit the side effects of performance-enhancing features in modern microprocessors to expose secret data through side channels in the microarchitecture. The well known implementations of these attacks exploit cache-based side channels since they are the least noisy channels to exfiltrate data. While some software patches attempted to mitigate these attacks, they are ad-hoc and only try to fix the side effects of the vulnerabilites. They may also impose a performance overhead of up to 30%. In this paper, we present a microarchitecture-based solution for Meltdown and Spectre that addresses the vulnerabilities exploited by the attacks. Our solution prevents flushed instructions from exposing data to the cache. Our approach can also be extended to other memory structures in the microarchitecture thereby preventing variants of the attacks which exploit these memory structures. We further identify two new variant attacks based on exploiting the side effects of speculative and out-of-order execution and show how our solution can be used to prevent these attacks. Evaluation results show that our microarchitectural solution not only restores secure out-of-order and speculative execution, but also has relatively low overhead and does not significantly impact performance for most applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17726v1\n    "}}

They can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose that the emergence of 1-form symmetries is information-theoretic in nature, precisely characterized by the preservation of information about how quantum states transform under the symmetry. As a consequence, the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition which we argue to be revealed from the long-range entanglement in the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to efficiently detect 1-form symmetries with a global quantum error correction (QEC) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As a practical application of our framework, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately determined by a disorder parameter. We further argue that our proposed theory for emergent 1-form symmetries offers new perspectives on particle condensation and suggests sharp information-theoretic phase boundaries between Higgs and confining regimes in the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17572v3\n    "}}

With common noises introduced by the stock capitalization processes, we establish a conditional McKean-Vlasov system to study the market dynamics coupled to the expected trading volume of investors. We show that optimal arbitrage can be characterized as a solution of a Cauchy PDE constructed by the volatility terms in the market model. The structure of the market dynamics can be relaxed, and we provide a theoretical framework to study a general mean-field system, where the interaction is characterized by a joint distribution of wealth and strategies. In this setting, the optimal relative arbitrage constitutes the strong equilibrium of an extended mean-field game. We provide conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the mean-field equilibrium. We further prove the propagation of chaos result for the finite-player game counterpart, and demonstrate that the Nash equilibrium converges to the mean field equilibrium when the population grows to infinity.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02690v3\n    "}}

Unlike state-of-the-art methods that adapt vanilla Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to the RF domain with scene-specific training, GRaF generalizes across scenes to synthesize spectra. To enable this, we prove an interpolation theory in the RF domain: the spatial spectrum from a transmitter can be approximated using spectra from geographically proximate transmitters. Building on this theory, GRaF comprises two components: (i) a geometry-aware Transformer encoder that captures spatial correlations from neighboring transmitters to learn a scene-independent latent RF radiance field, and (ii) a neural ray tracing algorithm that estimates spectrum reception at the receiver. Experimental results demonstrate that GRaF outperforms existing methods on single-scene benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen scene layouts.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05708v2\n    "}}

However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security lens, analyzing how existing works diverge in sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility.\n  To this end, we construct a unified evaluation framework to expose these issues empirically and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics such as per-class EER, Frequency Count of Scores (FCS), and the Gini Coefficient uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. The resulting analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces--including replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation--and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles.

To study this question, we introduce a minimal coding abstraction that we call a zero-bit tamper-detection code. This is a secret-key procedure that samples a pseudorandom codeword and, given a candidate word, decides whether it should be treated as unmarked content or as the result of tampering with a valid codeword. It captures the two core requirements of robust watermarking: soundness and tamper detection.\n  Within this abstraction we prove a sharp unconditional limit on robustness to independent symbol corruption. For an alphabet of size $q$, there is a critical corruption rate of $1 - 1/q$ such that no scheme with soundness, even relaxed to allow a fixed constant false positive probability on random content, can reliably detect tampering once an adversary can change more than this fraction of symbols. In particular, in the binary case no cryptographic watermark can remain robust if more than half of the encoded bits are modified. We also show that this threshold is tight by giving simple information-theoretic constructions that achieve soundness and tamper detection for all strictly smaller corruption rates.\n  We then test experimentally whether this limit appears in practice by looking at the recent watermarking for images of Gunn, Zhao, and Song (ICLR 2025). We show that a simple crop and resize operation reliably flipped about half of the latent signs and consistently prevented belief-propagation decoding from recovering the codeword, erasing the watermark while leaving the image visually intact.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10577v2\n    "}}

However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15998v2\n    "}}

Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs. We discuss metadata privacy, key registry requirements, and regulatory considerations (HIPAA/GDPR), demonstrating a practical route to restoring patient control while preserving security properties required for sensitive clinical data.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17464v1\n    "}}

We propose a novel framework that integrates Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) with a hypernetwork-based architecture to enable certifiably robust continual learning across sequential tasks. Our method, SHIELD, generates task-specific model parameters via a shared hypernetwork conditioned solely on compact task embeddings, eliminating the need for replay buffers or full model copies and enabling efficient over time. To further enhance robustness, we introduce Interval MixUp, a novel training strategy that blends virtual examples represented as $\\ell_{\\infty}$ balls centered around MixUp points. Leveraging interval arithmetic, this technique guarantees certified robustness while mitigating the wrapping effect, resulting in smoother decision boundaries. We evaluate SHIELD under strong white-box adversarial attacks, including PGD and AutoAttack, across multiple benchmarks. It consistently outperforms existing robust continual learning methods, achieving state-of-the-art average accuracy while maintaining both scalability and certification. These results represent a significant step toward practical and theoretically grounded continual learning in adversarial settings.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08255v3\n    "}}

Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \u03b1>D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\\exp(\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2(N/\u03b5)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\u03b5$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Koteck\u00fd and Preiss.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20901v2\n    "}}

However, decision support requires maintaining data privacy, integrity, and availability while ensuring customization, security, and verifiability of the decision process. Existing solutions fail to guarantee those properties altogether. Most commercial tools cater for data integrity and process customization but are centralized. This centralization potentially compromises data privacy and availability, as well as process security and verifiability. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPARTA, an approach based on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that automates decision processes. To maintain data privacy, integrity, and availability, SPARTA employs efficient cryptographic techniques on notarized data with access mediated through user-defined access policies. Our solution also allows users to define decision rules, which are translated to certified software objects deployed within TEEs, thereby guaranteeing customization, verifiability, and security of the process. Based on experiments conducted on public benchmarks and synthetic data, we show that our approach is scalable and adds limited overhead compared to non-cryptographically secured solutions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02413v2\n    "}}

The system first executes standard quantum circuits with random shot patterns across different devices to generate entropy profiles and measurement data that reveal device-specific behavior. A Bell or CHSH test is then used to confirm that correlations originate from genuine non classical processes rather than classical simulation. The verified outcomes are converted into statistical fingerprints using entropy, divergence, and bias features to characterize each device. These features and metadata for device, session, and random seed parameters are digitally signed and time stamped to ensure integrity and traceability. Authenticated artifacts are stored in a hierarchical index for reproducible retrieval and long term auditing. A visualization and analytics interface monitors drift, policy enforcement, and device behavior logs. A machine learning engine tracks entropy drift, detects anomalies, and classifies devices based on evolving patterns. An external verification API supports independent recomputation of hashes, signatures, and CHSH evidence. QDNA-ID operates as a continuous feedback loop that maintains a persistent chain of trust for quantum computing environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17692v1\n    "}}

Although machine learning models have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems. Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \\textit{role play} prompting, whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor anomalies, and \\textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives. These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable IoT systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02894v3\n    "}}

Thread has emerged as a key protocol, widely used in smart-home and commercial systems, and serving as a core transport layer in the Matter standard. This paper presents ThreadFuzzer, the first dedicated fuzzing framework for systematically testing Thread protocol implementations. By manipulating packets at the MLE layer, ThreadFuzzer enables fuzzing of both virtual OpenThread nodes and physical Thread devices. The framework incorporates multiple fuzzing strategies, including Random and Coverage-based fuzzers from CovFuzz, as well as a newly introduced TLV Inserter, designed specifically for TLV-structured MLE messages. These strategies are evaluated on the OpenThread stack using code-coverage and vulnerability-discovery metrics. The evaluation uncovered five previously unknown vulnerabilities in the OpenThread stack, several of which were successfully reproduced on commercial devices that rely on OpenThread. Moreover, ThreadFuzzer was benchmarked against an oracle AFL++ setup using the manually extended OSS-Fuzz harness from OpenThread, demonstrating strong effectiveness.

It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07250v3\n    "}}

Existing defenses predominantly rely on anomaly detection in parameter or gradient space, overlooking behavioral constraints that backdoor attacks must satisfy to ensure reliable trigger activation. These anomaly-centric methods fail against adaptive attacks that normalize update magnitudes and mimic benign statistical patterns while preserving backdoor functionality, creating a fundamental detection gap. To address this limitation, this paper introduces FeRA (Federated Representative Attention) -- a novel attention-driven defense that shifts the detection paradigm from anomaly-centric to consistency-centric analysis. FeRA exploits the intrinsic need for backdoor persistence across training rounds, identifying malicious clients through suppressed representation-space variance, an orthogonal property to traditional magnitude-based statistics. The framework conducts multi-dimensional behavioral analysis combining spectral and spatial attention, directional alignment, mutual similarity, and norm inflation across two complementary detection mechanisms: consistency analysis and norm-inflation detection. Through this mechanism, FeRA isolates malicious clients that exhibit low-variance consistency or magnitude amplification. Extensive evaluation across six datasets, nine attacks, and three model architectures under both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings confirm FeRA achieves superior backdoor mitigation. Under different non-IID settings, FeRA achieved the lowest average Backdoor Accuracy (BA), about 1.67% while maintaining high clean accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art defenses.

To address these challenges, researchers have turned towards integrating tools into LLM-powered agents to enhance the overall information fusion process. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture, resulting in a lack of modularity and terminological inconsistencies among researchers. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework (LLM-Agent-UMF) that establishes a clear foundation for agent development from both functional and software architectural perspectives, developed and evaluated using the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF). Our framework clearly distinguishes between the different components of an LLM-based agent, setting LLMs and tools apart from a new element, the core-agent, which plays the role of central coordinator. This pivotal entity comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security -- the latter often neglected in previous works. By classifying core-agents into passive and active types based on their authoritative natures, we propose various multi-core agent architectures that combine unique characteristics of distinctive agents to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. We evaluate our framework by applying it to thirteen state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assess five architecture variants of our framework by designing new agent architectures that combine characteristics of state-of-the-art agents to address specific goals. ...\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11393v3\n    "}}

Consequently, wideband RF modeling is essential for practical applications such as joint deployment of heterogeneous RF systems, cross-band communication, and distributed RF sensing. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques effectively reconstruct RF radiance fields at a single frequency, they cannot model fields at arbitrary or unknown frequencies across a wide range. In this paper, we present a novel 3DGS algorithm for unified wideband RF radiance field modeling. RF wave propagation depends on signal frequency and the 3D spatial environment, including geometry and material electromagnetic (EM) properties. To address these factors, we introduce a frequency-embedded EM feature network that utilizes 3D Gaussian spheres at each spatial location to learn the relationship between frequency and transmission characteristics, such as attenuation and radiance intensity. With a dataset containing sparse frequency samples in a specific 3D environment, our model can efficiently reconstruct RF radiance fields at arbitrary and unseen frequencies. To assess our approach, we introduce a large-scale power angular spectrum (PAS) dataset with 50,000 samples spanning 1 to 94 GHz across six indoor environments. Experimental results show that the proposed model trained on multiple frequencies achieves a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.922 for PAS reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art single-frequency 3DGS models with SSIM of 0.863.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20714v2\n    "}}

Although the vast majority of scientific contributions focus on improving the performance of RFF considering different parameters and scenarios, in this work, we consider RFF as an attack vector to identify a target device in the radio spectrum. \\\\ We propose, implement, and evaluate {\\em HidePrint}, a solution to prevent identification through RFF without affecting the quality of the communication link between the transmitter and the receiver. {\\em HidePrint} hides the transmitter's fingerprint against an illegitimate eavesdropper through the injection of controlled noise into the transmitted signal. We evaluate our solution against various state-of-the-art RFF techniques, considering several adversarial models, data from real-world communication links (wired and wireless), and protocol configurations. Our results show that the injection of a Gaussian noise pattern with a normalized standard deviation of (at least) 0.02 prevents device fingerprinting in all the considered scenarios, while affecting the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the received signal by only 0.1 dB. Moreover, we introduce {\\em selective radio fingerprint disclosure}, a new technique that allows the transmitter to disclose the radio fingerprint to only a subset of intended receivers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06417v2\n    "}}

We show that intermediate activations in decoder-only LLMs form a vulnerable attack surface for behavioral control. Building on recent findings on attention sinks and compression valleys, we identify a high-gain region in the residual stream where small, well-aligned perturbations are causally amplified along the autoregressive trajectory--a Causal Amplification Effect (CAE). We exploit this as an attack surface via Sensitivity-Scaled Steering (SSS), a progressive activation-level attack that combines beginning-of-sequence (BOS) anchoring with sensitivity-based reinforcement to focus a limited perturbation budget on the most vulnerable layers and tokens. We show that across multiple open-weight models and four behavioral axes, SSS induces large shifts in evil, hallucination, sycophancy, and sentiment while preserving high coherence and general capabilities, turning activation steering into a concrete security concern for white-box and supply-chain LLM deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17194v1\n    "}}

Our approach advances the existing literature in two important respects. First, we consider the problem under privacy constraints. Second, instead of testing whether the coordinates are pairwise independent, we are interested in determining whether certain pairwise associations between the components (such as all pairwise Kendall's $\u03c4$ coefficients) do not exceed a given threshold in absolute value. Considering hypotheses of this form is motivated by the observation that in the high-dimensional regime, it is rare and perhaps impossible to have a null hypothesis that can be modeled exactly by assuming that all pairwise associations are precisely equal to zero.\n  The formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis makes the problem of constructing tests already non-standard in the non-private setting. Additionally, under privacy constraints, state of the art procedures rely on permutation approaches that are rendered invalid under a composite null. We propose a novel bootstrap based methodology that is especially powerful in sparse settings, develop theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and show that the proposed method enjoys good finite sample properties even in the high privacy regime. Additionally, we present applications in medical data that showcase the applicability of our methodology.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17167v1\n    "}}

Rev. B} \\textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17144v1\n    "}}

We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers.

Scaling actions triggered by an anomaly detector help achieve target latency at the cost of extra resource consumption. However, performance anomaly detectors make mistakes. This paper studies which characteristics of performance anomaly detection are important to optimize the trade-off between performance and cost. Using Stochastic Reward Nets, we model a Cloud service monitored by a performance anomaly detector. Using our model, we study the impact of detector characteristics, namely precision, recall and inspection frequency, on the average latency and resource consumption of the monitored service. Our results show that achieving a high precision and a high recall is not always necessary. If detection can be run frequently, a high precision is enough to obtain a good performance-to-cost trade-off, but if the detector is run infrequently, recall becomes the most important.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17119v1\n    "}}

Each evidence item is a fixed-size tuple of cryptographic fields, designed to (i) provide strong binding to workflow events and configurations, (ii) support constant-size storage and uniform verification cost per event, and (iii) compose cleanly with hash-chain and Merkle-based audit constructions. We formalize a simple model of regulated AI workflows, define syntax and algorithms for evidence structures, and articulate security goals such as audit integrity and non-equivocation. We present a generic hash-and-sign construction that instantiates this abstraction using a collision-resistant hash function and a standard digital signature scheme. We then show how to integrate the construction with hash-chained logs, Merkle-tree anchoring, and optionally trusted execution environments, and we analyze the asymptotic complexity of evidence generation and verification. Finally, we implement a prototype library and report microbenchmark results on commodity hardware, demonstrating that the per-event overhead of constant-size evidence is small and predictable. The design is informed by industrial experience with regulated AI systems at Codebat Technologies Inc., while the paper focuses on the abstraction, algorithms, and their security and performance characteristics, with implications for clinical trial management, pharmaceutical compliance, and medical AI governance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17118v1\n    "}}

While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17113v1\n    "}}

By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17112v1\n    "}}

Existing solutions like model compression often sacrifice accuracy, while specialized hardware remains costly and inflexible. Hybrid inference methods, however, typically overlook how operator characteristics impact performance. In this work, we present SparOA, a CPU-GPU hybrid inference framework, which leverages both sparsity and computational intensity to optimize operator scheduling. SparOA embraces aforementioned challenges through three key components: (1) a threshold predictor that accurately determines optimal sparsity and computational intensity thresholds; (2) a reinforcement learning-based scheduler that dynamically optimizes resource allocation based on real-time hardware states; and (3) a hybrid inference engine that enhances efficiency through asynchronous execution and batch size optimization.Extensive results show that SparOA achieves an average speedup of 1.22-1.31x compared to all baselines, and outperforms the CPU-Only by up to 50.7x. Also, SparOA achieves optimal energy-per-inference, consuming 7\\%-16\\% less energy than the SOTA co-execution baseline.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19457v1\n    "}}

Routing protocols that were made for land-based networks, like RPL, don't work well in these underwater settings. This paper talks about RL-RPL-UA, a new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to make things work better in underwater situations. Each node has a small RL agent that picks the best parent node depending on local data such the link quality, buffer level, packet delivery ratio, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA works with all standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function to help people make decisions in real time. Aqua-Sim simulations demonstrate that RL-RPL-UA boosts packet delivery by up to 9.2%, uses 14.8% less energy per packet, and adds 80 seconds to the network's lifetime compared to previous approaches. These results show that RL-RPL-UA is a potential and energy-efficient way to route data in underwater networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00133v2\n    "}}

Methods based on API sequences play a crucial role in malware prevention. However, due to the continuous updates of APIs and the changes in API sequence calls leading to the constant evolution of malware variants, the detection capability of API sequence-based malware detection models significantly diminishes over time. We observe that the API sequences of malware samples before and after evolution usually have similar malicious semantics. Specifically, compared to the original samples, evolved malware samples often use the API sequences of the pre-evolution samples to achieve similar malicious behaviors. For instance, they access similar sensitive system resources and extend new malicious functions based on the original functionalities. In this paper, we propose a framework MME(Mitigating the impact of Malware Evolution), a framework that can enhance existing API sequence-based malware detectors and mitigate the adverse effects of malware evolution. To help detection models capture the similar semantics of these post-evolution API sequences, our framework represents API sequences using API knowledge graphs and system resource encodings and applies contrastive learning to enhance the model's encoder. Results indicate that, compared to regular Text-CNN, our framework can significantly reduce the false positive rate by 13.10% and improve the F1-Score by 8.47% on five years of data, achieving the best experimental results. Additionally, evaluations show that our framework can save on the human costs required for model maintenance. We only need 1% of the budget per month to reduce the false positive rate by 11.16% and improve the F1-Score by 6.44%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01661v2\n    "}}

Operating in dynamic on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector: environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence, pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning.

This work introduces a new paradigm with a core objective: to perform fast, data-efficient, and high-fidelity RF reconstruction of occluded 3D static scenes, using only a single, brief human walk. We argue that this unstructured motion is not noise, but is in fact an information-rich signal available for reconstruction. To achieve this, we design a factorization framework based on composite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that learns to model the dynamic effects of human motion from the persistent static scene geometry within a raw RF stream. Trained on just a single 60-second casual walk, our model reconstructs the full static scene with a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.96, remarkably outperforming heavily-sampled state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 12%. By transforming the human movements into its valuable signals, our method eliminates the data acquisition bottleneck and paves the way for on-the-fly 3D RF mapping of unseen environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16966v1\n    "}}

Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16964v1\n    "}}

Utilizing recent academic research and real-world blockchain data, the study highlights that PoW offers robust, time-tested security but suffers from high energy consumption, slower throughput, and centralization through mining pools. In contrast, PoS demonstrates improved scalability and efficiency, significantly reduced environmental impact, and more stable transaction fees, however it raises concerns over validator centralization and long-term security maturity. The findings underscore the trade-offs inherent in each mechanism and suggest hybrid designs may combine PoW's security with PoS's efficiency and sustainability.

However, existing risky prompt datasets are limited in three key areas: 1) limited risky categories, 2) coarse-grained annotation, and 3) low effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce T2I-RiskyPrompt, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating safety-related tasks in T2I models. Specifically, we first develop a hierarchical risk taxonomy, which consists of 6 primary categories and 14 fine-grained subcategories. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct a pipeline to collect and annotate risky prompts. Finally, we obtain 6,432 effective risky prompts, where each prompt is annotated with both hierarchical category labels and detailed risk reasons. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation, we propose a reason-driven risky image detection method that explicitly aligns the MLLM with safety annotations. Based on T2I-RiskyPrompt, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight T2I models, nine defense methods, five safety filters, and five attack strategies, offering nine key insights into the strengths and limitations of T2I model safety. Finally, we discuss potential applications of T2I-RiskyPrompt across various research fields.

These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07772v2\n    "}}

However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments.

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design instructions for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17987v3\n    "}}

However, the dynamic nature of MoE leads to load imbalance among experts, severely impacting training efficiency. While previous research has attempted to address the load balancing challenge, existing solutions either compromise model accuracy or introduce additional system overhead. As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency.\n  We propose MicroEP, a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems. MicroEP is capable of achieving optimal load balancing in every micro-batch through efficient token scheduling across GPUs. Furthermore, we propose MicroMoE, an efficient distributed MoE training system with MicroEP's load balancing capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that MicroMoE improves the end-to-end training throughput by up to 47.6% compared with the state-of-the-art system, and almost consistently achieves optimal load balance among GPUs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16947v1\n    "}}

Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \\textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \\textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap. (3) Existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against such reasoning-based attacks. MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving VLMs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16940v1\n    "}}

Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically require deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and imperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum circuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for quantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising path forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational ansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli propagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that implement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and beyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to $30 \\times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard Trotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To experimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on Quantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's dynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without optimization. Our circuit compression scheme brings us one step closer to a practical quantum advantage by allowing longer simulation times at reduced quantum resources and unlocks the exploration of large families of hardware-friendly ans\u00e4tze.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01883v2\n    "}}

In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for a typical macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\u03c6_0\\rangle$, the quantum state $|\u03c6'_0\\rangle = \\hat{O}(t)|\u03c6_0\\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In typical macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is inevitable.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01351v5\n    "}}

Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824). Compared to exact solvers, the proposed approach reduces the execution time by 86.1%, while closely tracking the optimal system cost (within 6.1% in representative regimes). Compared with baseline models, DeepSets-S consistently achieves higher cost ratios and better utilization across COIN/MEC resources.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13313v2\n    "}}

This thermalization mechanism can be demonstrated by the sequence of $\\hat{O}_i(t_i)$, where $\\hat{O_i}$ is a local operator, $\\hat{O_i}(t_i) = e^{i\\hat{H}t_i} \\hat{O_i} e^{-i\\hat{H}t_i}$, $\\hat{H}$ is the system Hamiltonian, $t_i$ can take positive, negative, or zero values, and the sequence is arranged according to the subscript $i$. We numerically demonstrate the information erasure of initial non-equilibrium quantum states through such sequence in a one-dimensional Hubbard model. During this process, the system's entanglement entropy increases monotonically toward a stable value. By incorporating this information erasure mechanism into an isolated system, our numerical simulations reveal that in this completely isolated system, a thermalization process emerges.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04152v3\n    "}}

In practice, network delay variation and recovery dynamics at the receiver distort this cadence even when transports deliver all packets correctly, which produces visible jitter, stalls, and unstable playback.\n  We present a lightweight receiver-side scheduling approach that regularizes release timing after recovery. The scheduler maintains an adaptive estimate of effective path delay and adjusts release times asymmetrically, responding quickly to late arrivals and only gradually to early ones. This upper-envelope behavior keeps release aligned with recent delay peaks and maintains smooth playback with minimal added latency. The scheduler runs entirely on the receiver clock and requires no feedback or synchronization.\n  As a concrete example, we integrate receiver-side scheduling into the BitRipple Tunnel (BRT) overlay, an application-layer software system that forwards traffic without altering the underlying transport protocol. Within BRT, the scheduler functions as an independent module that regulates delivery timing for forwarded objects.\n  Evaluating BRT with receiver-side scheduling on a cloud-gaming workload shows that the scheduler removes virtually all large jitter excursions and yields tightly clustered release intervals that improve visible smoothness. Broader latency improvements arise from the behavior of the full BRT overlay. Receiver-side scheduling can also be integrated modularly into transport stacks such as TCP, QUIC, WebRTC, UDP, or RTP, which are natural deployment points for future work.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16902v1\n    "}}

Here, we report on the realization of an optical sensor where non-reciprocal light propagation allows detecting small perturbations with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that scales exponentially with system size. Our approach is based on encoding two Hatano-Nelson (HN) chains, which is equivalent to the bosonic Kitaev model, within the resonant modes of an electro-optics frequency comb. Non-reciprocal light propagation in the frequency domain is realized through simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation of the circulating field inside the optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate the sensing of a small modulating tone coupling the two HN chains with a SNR that scales exponentially with the lattice size, formed from up to 70 frequency modes per chain. Our results open a new paradigm in non-Hermitian sensing, with potential applications in remote sensing including the optical readout of superconducting circuits.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16895v1\n    "}}

A common criticism of blockchain networks has been their energy consumption and operational costs. The switch from Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol has significantly reduced this issue, though concerns remain, especially with network expansions via additional layers. The ERC-4337 standard is a recent proposal that facilitates end-user access to Ethereum-backed applications. It introduces a middleware called a bundler, operated as a third-party service, where part of its operational cost is represented by its power consumption. While bundlers have served over 500 million requests in the past two years, fewer than 15 official bundler providers exist, compared to over 100 regular Ethereum access providers. In this paper, we provide a first look at the active power consumption overhead that a bundler would add to an Ethereum access service. Using SmartWatts, a monitoring system leveraging Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) hardware interfaces, we empirically determine correlations between the bundler workload and its active power consumption.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16890v1\n    "}}

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17666v1\n    "}}

A central challenge in many-body physics is that the identity of quantum phases, especially those with topological order, are often inaccessible through local observables or simple symmetry-breaking diagnostics. Here, we apply QDL techniques to the 2+1-dimensional toric-code loop-gas model in a magnetic field. Ground states are generated across multiple lattice sizes using a parametrized loop-gas circuit (PLGC) with a variational quantum-eigensolver (VQE) approach. We then train a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) across the full field-parameter range to perform phase classification and capture the overall phase structure. We also employ a physics-aware training protocol that excludes the near-critical region (0.2 <= x <= 0.4)) around (x_c = 0.25), the phase-transition point estimated by quantum Monte Carlo, reserving this window for testing to evaluate the ability of the model to learn the phase transition. In parallel, we implement an unsupervised quantum k-means method based on state overlaps, which partitions the dataset into two phases without prior labeling. Our supervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and accurately locates the phase transition, in close agreement with previously reported values; the unsupervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and locates the phase transition with a small offset as expected in finite volumes; both QDL methods outperform classical alternatives. These findings establish QDL as an effective framework for characterizing topological quantum matter, studying finite volume effects, and probing phase diagrams of higher-dimensional systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16851v1\n    "}}

Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16822v1\n    "}}

Although AI agents' privacy policies describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual tool that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance with stated privacy policies.\n  AudAgent consists of four components for automated privacy auditing of AI agents. (i) Policy formalization: a novel cross-LLM voting mechanism to guarantee confidence of the parsed privacy policy model. (ii) Runtime annotation: a lightweight Presidio-based analyzer detects sensitive data and annotates data practices based on the AI agent's context and the privacy policy model. (iii) Compliance auditing: ontology graphs and automata-based checking connect the privacy policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checking. (iv) User interface: an infrastructure-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy policy violations, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability.\n  We evaluate AudAgent with AI agents built using mainstream frameworks, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and visualizing privacy policy violations in real time. Using AudAgent, we also find that most privacy policies omit explicit safeguards for highly sensitive data such as SSNs, whose misuse violates legal requirements, and that many agents do not refuse handling such data via third-party tools, including those controlled by Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. AudAgent proactively blocks operations on such data, overriding the agents' original privacy policy and behavior.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07441v2\n    "}}

While state-of-the-art LMs often boast hundreds of billions of parameters and are primarily deployed in data centers, recent trends show a growing focus on compact models-typically under 10 billion parameters-enabled by techniques such as quantization and other model compression techniques. This shift paves the way for LMs on edge devices, offering potential benefits such as enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and improved data sovereignty. However, the inherent complexity of even these smaller models, combined with the limited computing resources of edge hardware, raises critical questions about the practical trade-offs in executing LM inference outside the cloud. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive evaluation of generative LM inference on representative CPU-based and GPU-accelerated edge devices. Our study measures key performance indicators-including memory usage, inference speed, and energy consumption-across various device configurations. Additionally, we examine throughput-energy trade-offs, cost considerations, and usability, alongside an assessment of qualitative model performance. While quantization helps mitigate memory overhead, it does not fully eliminate resource bottlenecks, especially for larger models. Our findings quantify the memory and energy constraints that must be considered for practical real-world deployments, offering concrete insights into the trade-offs between model size, inference performance, and efficiency. The exploration of LMs at the edge is still in its early stages. We hope this study provides a foundation for future research, guiding the refinement of models, the enhancement of inference efficiency, and the advancement of edge-centric AI systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09114v2\n    "}}

However, accurately estimating flow frequencies is challenging due to the large number of flows and increasing network speeds. Hardware accelerators are often used in this endeavor due to their high computational power, but their limited amount of on-chip memory constrains their performance. Various sketch-based algorithms have been proposed to estimate properties of traffic such as frequency, with lower memory usage and theoretical bounds, but they often under perform with the skewed distribution of network traffic. In this work, we propose an algorithm for top-K identification using a modified TowerSketch and a priority queue array. Tested on real traffic traces, we identify the top-K flows, with K up to 32,768, with a precision of more than 0.94, and estimate their frequency with an average relative error under 1.96%. We designed and implemented an accelerator for this algorithm on an AMD VirtexU280 UltraScale+ FPGA, which processes one packet per cycle at392 MHz, reaching a minimum line rate of more than 200 Gbps.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16797v1\n    "}}

These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize). Our findings reveal that these samples are often outliers within their classes (e.g., noisy or hard to classify). We then propose potential defensive strategies to protect these vulnerable samples and enhance the privacy-preserving capabilities of ML models.

While provably efficient protocols for Markovian models of quantum simulators, either closed system models (described by a Hamiltonian) or open system models (described by a Lindbladian), have been developed, it remains less well understood whether similar protocols for non-Markovian models exist. In this paper, we consider geometrically local lattice models with both quantum and classical non-Markovian noise and show that, under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, we can learn the noise with sample complexity scaling logarithmically with the system size. Our protocol requires preparing the simulator qubits initially in a product state, introducing a layer of single-qubit Clifford gates and measuring product observables.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16772v1\n    "}}

This paradigm is rapidly gaining traction worldwide, supported by numerous initiatives such as the European Digital Identity (EUDI) Regulation or Singapore's National Digital Identity (NDI). For instance, by 2026, the EUDI Regulation will enable all European citizens to seamlessly access services across Europe using Verifiable Credentials (VCs). A key feature of SSI is the ability to selectively disclose only specific claims within a credential, enhancing the privacy protection of the identity owner. This paper proposes a novel mechanism designed to achieve Compact and Selective Disclosure for VCs (CSD-JWT). Our method leverages a cryptographic accumulator to encode claims within a credential into a unique, compact representation. We implemented CSD-JWT as an open-source solution and extensively evaluated its performance under various conditions. CSD-JWT provides significant memory savings, lowering usage by up to 46% compared to the state-of-the-art. It also minimizes network overhead by producing remarkably smaller Verifiable Presentations (VPs), with size reduction from 27% to 93%. Such features make CSD-JWT especially well-suited for resource-constrained devices, including hardware wallets designed for managing credentials.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00262v2\n    "}}

This task is complicated by the need to analyze the intricate coupling between complex software behavior and the system's physical dynamics. Furthermore, the periodic execution of control code in CPS applications creates a combinatorial explosion of execution paths that must be analyzed over time, far exceeding the scope of traditional single-run code analysis.\n  This paper introduces RampoNN, a novel framework that systematically identifies kinetic vulnerabilities given the control code, a physical system model, and a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specification of safe behavior. RampoNN first analyzes the control code to map the control signals that can be generated under various execution branches. It then employs a neural network to abstract the physical system's behavior. To overcome the poor scaling and loose over-approximations of standard neural network reachability, RampoNN uniquely utilizes Deep Bernstein neural networks, which are equipped with customized reachability algorithms that yield orders of magnitude tighter bounds. This high-precision reachability analysis allows RampoNN to rapidly prune large sets of guaranteed-safe behaviors and rank the remaining traces by their potential to violate the specification. The results of this analysis are then used to effectively guide a falsification engine, focusing its search on the most promising system behaviors to find actual vulnerabilities.\n  We evaluated our approach on a PLC-controlled water tank system and a switched PID controller for an automotive engine. The results demonstrate that RampoNN leads to acceleration of the process of finding kinetic vulnerabilities by up to 98.27% and superior scalability compared to other state-of-the-art methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16765v1\n    "}}

The growing demand for uplink-intensive applications, such as real-time UHD 4K/8K video streaming and Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR) content, highlights the need for accurate uplink throughput prediction to optimize user Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we introduce UplinkNet, a compact neural network designed to predict future uplink throughput using past throughput and RF parameters available through the Android API. With a model size limited to approximately 4,000 parameters, UplinkNet is suitable for IoT and low-power devices. The network was trained on real-world drive test data from commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in Tokyo, Japan, and Bangkok, Thailand, across various mobility conditions.

The 3GPP introduced 256QAM support for FR2 frequency bands to further enhance downlink capacity. However, sustaining 256QAM on FR2 in practical environments is challenging due to strong path loss and susceptibility to distortion. While 256QAM can improve theoretical throughput by 33%, compared to 64QAM, and is widely adopted in FR1, its real-world impact when utilized in FR2 is questionable, given the significant path loss and distortions experienced in the FR2 range. Additionally, using higher modulation correlates to higher BLER, increased instability, and retransmission. Moreover, 256QAM also utilizes a different MCS table defining the modulation and code rate at different Channel Quality Indexes (CQI), affecting the UE's link adaptation behavior. This paper investigates the real-world performance of 256QAM utilization on FR2 bands in two countries, across three RAN manufacturers, and in both NSA (EN-DC) and SA (NR-DC) configurations, under various scenarios, including open-air plazas, city centers, footbridges, train station platforms, and stationary environments. The results show that 256QAM provides a reasonable throughput gain when stationary but marginal improvements when there is UE mobility while increasing the probability of NACK responses, increasing BLER, and the number of retransmissions. Finally, MATLAB simulations are run to validate the findings as well as explore the effect of the recently introduced 1024QAM on FR2.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03416v2\n    "}}

As a result, Uplink MIMO (UL-MIMO) and Uplink Carrier Aggregation (UL-CA) have been widely deployed for the first time on commercial 5G networks. UL-MIMO enables the transmission of two data streams on one frequency band in strong RF conditions, theoretically doubling throughput and efficiency. On the other hand, UL-CA allows for simultaneous upload on greater channel widths, allowing more resources to be assigned to a single UE for higher throughput. In the United States, T-Mobile USA, a mobile network operator (MNO), has deployed network-wide 5G Standalone (SA), along with UL-MIMO on Time Division Duplex (TDD) band n41 and UL-CA between TDD and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) NR bands. In this paper, the uplink throughput performance of UL-MIMO and UL-CA will be evaluated on the commercial T-Mobile 5G network on a variety of RF environments and modes of transportation. It was found that, even with the efficiency gains, UL-MIMO yields slower uplink throughput in most scenarios. However, in stronger RF conditions, UL-MIMO can provide an adequate user experience, so capacity can be conserved by reserving UL-CA for UE in weaker RF conditions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16751v1\n    "}}

Along these lines, in periodically driven dissipative systems within the effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian approximation spectral winding numbers have been linked to intriguing nonreciprocal transport properties. Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \\emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model. In addition, we find that the NH skin effect, i.e.~the accumulation of a macroscopic number of eigenstates at one end of the system, is already visible in the transient dynamics even for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our results exemplify the subtle correspondence between NH topological properties and physical manifestations of Liouvillian topological properties in open quantum systems, thus providing a theoretical framework towards understanding unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16742v1\n    "}}

Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16739v1\n    "}}

However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. We present recent advancements on these topics including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. We also highlight the scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16738v1\n    "}}

Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence. Here, we revisit this problem from a more analytical perspective. Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered. When the temperature is sufficiently low that neither of these occur, then ARA succeeds. Remarkably, there are even situations in which the environment benefits ARA: we find parameter values for which no transition-avoiding paths exist at zero temperature but such paths appear at non-zero temperature.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16735v1\n    "}}

However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.

In this work, a basic scenario, namely free fermions in an expanding universe, is considered and quantum simulations are used to perform the evolution and study the phenomena involved. Using digital quantum simulations with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter expansion, the evolutions of fermion number density, correlation functions, polarization, and chiral condensation are analyzed. A spread out phenomenon can be observed in the simulation, which is a consequence of momentum redshift.

This behavior significantly increases security risks, also due to the fact that traditional password strength evaluation methods are often inadequate. In this discussion paper, we present SODA ADVANCE, a data reconstruction tool also designed to enhance evaluation processes related to the password strength. In particular, SODA ADVANCE integrates a specialized module aimed at evaluating password strength by leveraging publicly available data from multiple sources, including social media platforms. Moreover, we investigate the capabilities and risks associated with emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) in evaluating and generating passwords, respectively. Experimental assessments conducted with 100 real users demonstrate that LLMs can generate strong and personalized passwords possibly defined according to user profiles. Additionally, LLMs were shown to be effective in evaluating passwords, especially when they can take into account user profile data.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16716v1\n    "}}

While holding great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose BioRiskEval, a framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. BioRiskEval assesses models' virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling, mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation models.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27629v4\n    "}}

Adaptive Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) is a steganographic method valued for its high embedding capacity and invisibility, posing challenges for traditional steganalysis. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for detecting APVD steganography and performing reverse steganalysis, which reconstructs the hidden payload. We present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an attention mechanism and two output heads for simultaneous stego detection and payload recovery. Trained and validated on 10,000 images from the BOSSbase and UCID datasets, our model achieves a detection accuracy of 96.2 percent. It also reconstructs embedded payloads with up to 93.6 percent recovery at lower embedding densities. Results indicate a strong inverse relationship between payload size and recovery accuracy. This study reveals a vulnerability in adaptive steganography and provides a tool for digital forensic analysis, while encouraging reassessment of data security in the age of AI-driven techniques.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16604v1\n    "}}

This result is shown through a new technique, called round elimination via self-reduction. The lower bound proof is beautiful and presents very nice ideas. However, it spans more than 25 pages of technical details, and hence it is hard to digest and generalize to other problems. Historically, the simplification of proofs and techniques has marked an important turning point in our understanding of the complexity of graph problems. Our paper makes a step forward towards this direction, and provides the following contributions.\n  1. We present a short and simplified version of the round elimination via self-reduction technique. The simplification of this technique enables us to obtain the following two hardness results.\n  2. We show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that solves the maximal $b$-matching problem requires $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\log_{1+b}\u0394, \\log_\u0394n\\})$ and $\u03a9(\\sqrt{\\log_{1+b} n})$ rounds. We recall that the $b$-matching problem is a generalization of the matching problem where each vertex can have up to $b$ incident edges in the matching. As a corollary, for $b=1$, we obtain a short proof for the maximal matching lower bound shown by Khoury and Schild.\n  3. Finally, we show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that properly colors the edges of a graph with $\u0394+ k$ colors requires $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\log \u0394, \\log_\u0394n\\})$ and $\u03a9(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ rounds, for any $k\\le \u0394^{1-\\varepsilon}$ and any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19972v2\n    "}}

Blockchain ledgers are generally tamper-proof and thus enforce non-repudiation for transactions recorded within the same network. However, such a guarantee does not hold for cross-blockchain transactions. When disruptions occur due to malicious activities or system failures within one blockchain network, foreign networks can take advantage by denying legitimate claims or mounting fraudulent liabilities against the defenseless network. In response, this paper introduces InterSnap, a novel blockchain snapshot archival methodology, for enabling auditability of crossblockchain transactions, enforcing non-repudiation. InterSnap introduces cross-chain transaction receipts that ensure their irrefutability. Snapshots of ledger data along with these receipts are utilized as non-repudiable proof of bilateral agreements among different networks. InterSnap enhances system resilience through a distributed snapshot generation process, need-based snapshot scheduling process, and archival storage and sharing via decentralized platforms. Through a prototype implementation based on Hyperledger Fabric, we conducted experiments using on-premise machines, AWS public cloud instances, as well as a private cloud infrastructure. We establish that InterSnap can recover from malicious attacks while preserving crosschain transaction receipts. Additionally, our proposed solution demonstrates adaptability to increasing loads while securely transferring snapshot archives with minimal overhead.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16560v1\n    "}}

Classical distributed algorithms assume that nodes follow the prescribed protocol, but this assumption fails when nodes are strategic and may deviate if doing so increases their expected utility.\n  Standard MIS algorithms rely on honest randomness or unique identifiers to break symmetry. In rational settings, however, agents may manipulate randomness, and relying solely on identifiers can create unfairness, giving some nodes zero probability of joining the MIS and thus no incentive to participate. To address these issues, we propose two algorithms based on a utility model in which agents seek locally correct solutions while also having preferences over which solution is chosen. Randomness in our algorithms is generated through pairwise interactions between neighboring nodes, viewed as simple games in which no single node can unilaterally affect the outcome. This allows symmetry breaking while remaining compatible with rational behavior.\n  For both algorithms, we prove that at every stage of the execution, given any history, no agent can increase its expected utility through a unilateral deviation, assuming others follow the algorithm. This gives a stronger guarantee than Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium. When all nodes follow the protocol, every node has a positive probability of joining the MIS, and the final output is a correct MIS. Under mild additional assumptions, both algorithms terminate in $O(\\log n)$ rounds with high probability.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16533v1\n    "}}

While languages like Solidity and Move aim to improve smart contract security, vulnerabilities persist. This paper presents Smartify, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically detect and repair vulnerabilities in Solidity and Move smart contracts. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on vast pre-training datasets, Smartify employs a team of specialized agents working on different specially fine-tuned LLMs to analyze code based on underlying programming concepts and language-specific security principles. We evaluated Smartify on a dataset for Solidity and a curated dataset for Move, demonstrating its effectiveness in fixing a wide range of vulnerabilities. Our results show that Smartify (Gemma2+codegemma) achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLMs and enhancing general-purpose models' capabilities, such as Llama 3.1. Notably, Smartify can incorporate language-specific knowledge, such as the nuances of Move, without requiring massive language-specific pre-training datasets. This work offers a detailed analysis of various LLMs' performance on smart contract repair, highlighting the strengths of our multi-agent approach and providing a blueprint for developing more secure and reliable decentralized applications in the growing blockchain landscape. We also provide a detailed recipe for extending this to other similar use cases.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18515v2\n    "}}

SKQD approximates the ground state of a Hamiltonian, employing a hybrid quantum-classical approach: (i) constructing a Krylov space from bitstrings sampled from time-evolved quantum states, and (ii) classically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian within this subspace. We study the dependence of the ground-state energy and particle number on the value of the $\u03b8$-term, accurately capturing the model's phase structure. The algorithm is implemented on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating consistent performance across platforms. We show that SKQD substantially reduces the effective Hilbert space, and although the Krylov space dimension still scales exponentially, the slower growth underscores its promise for simulating lattice gauge theories in larger volumes.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26951v2\n    "}}

To address this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification.

Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16468v1\n    "}}

However, FL faces critical challenges related to communication overhead and local resource constraints, especially in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. The sheer size of these models exacerbates both memory and communication constraints, making efficient transmission and processing essential for practical deployment. NVIDIA FLARE, an open-source SDK for federated learning, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced communication capabilities. Building upon existing solutions for large object streaming, we enhance FL workflows for LLMs through two key techniques: message quantization and container/file streaming.

While previous research has primarily focused on white-box attacks with constrained optimizations, and transferability based black-box attacks against commercial Automatic Speech Recognition devices, this paper explores cost efficient white-box attack and non transferability black-box adversarial attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition systems, drawing insights from approaches such as Fast Gradient Sign Method and Zeroth-Order Optimization. Further, the novelty of the paper includes how poisoning attack can degrade the performances of state-of-the-art models leading to misinterpretation of audio signals. Through experimentation and analysis, we illustrate how hybrid models can generate subtle yet impactful adversarial examples with very little perturbation having Signal Noise Ratio of 35dB that can be generated within a minute. These vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art open source model have practical security implications, and emphasize the need for adversarial security.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22060v2\n    "}}

Although PDF documents are prominent sources of knowledge, text-based RAG pipelines are ineffective at capturing their rich multi-modal information. In contrast, visual document RAG (VD-RAG) uses screenshots of document pages as the KB, which has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, by introducing the image modality, VD-RAG introduces new attack vectors for adversaries to disrupt the system by injecting malicious documents into the KB. In this paper, we demonstrate the vulnerability of VD-RAG to poisoning attacks targeting both retrieval and generation. We define two attack objectives and demonstrate that both can be realized by injecting only a single adversarial image into the KB. Firstly, we introduce a targeted attack against one or a group of queries with the goal of spreading targeted disinformation. Secondly, we present a universal attack that, for any potential user query, influences the response to cause a denial-of-service in the VD-RAG system. We investigate the two attack objectives under both white-box and black-box assumptions, employing a multi-objective gradient-based optimization approach as well as prompting state-of-the-art generative models. Using two visual document datasets, a diverse set of state-of-the-art retrievers (embedding models) and generators (vision language models), we show VD-RAG is vulnerable to poisoning attacks in both the targeted and universal settings, yet demonstrating robustness to black-box attacks in the universal setting.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02132v3\n    "}}

We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16377v1\n    "}}

However, these models inherit critical limitations found in deep learning such as the lack of explainability, robustness, adaptability, and verifiable compliance with physical and regulatory constraints. In addition, the vision for an AI-native 6G network demands a level of intelligence that is deeply embedded into the systems and is trustworthy. In this vision paper, we argue that the neuro-symbolic paradigm, which integrates data-driven neural networks with rule- and logic-based symbolic reasoning, is essential for bridging this gap. We envision a novel Neuro-Symbolic framework that integrates universal RF embeddings with symbolic knowledge graphs and differentiable logic layers. This hybrid approach enables models to learn from large datasets while reasoning over explicit domain knowledge, enabling trustworthy, generalizable, and efficient wireless AI that can meet the demands of future networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16369v1\n    "}}

This paper discusses the evolution of wireless AI, emphasizing the transition from isolated task-specific models to more generalizable and adaptable AI models inspired by recent successes in large language models (LLMs) and computer vision. To overcome task-specific AI strategies in wireless networks, we propose a unified wireless physical-layer foundation model (WPFM). Challenges include the design of effective pre-training tasks, support for embedding heterogeneous time series and human-understandable interaction. The paper presents a strategic framework, focusing on embedding wireless time series, self-supervised pre-training, and semantic representation learning. The proposed WPFM aims to understand and describe diverse wireless signals, allowing human interactivity with wireless networks.

We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS.

Prior work have explored the possibility of directly jailbreaking the embodied agents through elaborated multi-modal prompts. However, no prior work has studied or even reported indirect jailbreaks in embodied AI, where a black-box attacker induces a jailbreak without issuing direct prompts to the embodied agent. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, indirect environmental jailbreak (IEJ), a novel attack to jailbreak embodied AI via indirect prompt injected into the environment, such as malicious instructions written on a wall. Our key insight is that embodied AI does not ''think twice'' about the instructions provided by the environment -- a blind trust that attackers can exploit to jailbreak the embodied agent. We further design and implement open-source prototypes of two fully-automated frameworks: SHAWSHANK, the first automatic attack generation framework for the proposed attack IEJ; and SHAWSHANK-FORGE, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for IEJ. Then, using SHAWSHANK-FORGE, we automatically construct SHAWSHANK-BENCH, the first benchmark for indirectly jailbreaking embodied agents. Together, our two frameworks and one benchmark answer the questions of what content can be used for malicious IEJ instructions, where they should be placed, and how IEJ can be systematically evaluated. Evaluation results show that SHAWSHANK outperforms eleven existing methods across 3,957 task-scene combinations and compromises all six tested VLMs. Furthermore, current defenses only partially mitigate our attack, and we have responsibly disclosed our findings to all affected VLM vendors.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16347v1\n    "}}

Since late 2022, a flurry of research has demonstrated steady progress from ideation to prototype implementation. While promising, evaluations show only incremental progress in real-world deployments, and the field still lacks a cohesive understanding of the emerging architectural patterns, core challenges, and evaluation paradigms. To fill this gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper provides the first comprehensive overview and analysis of this new domain. We survey and systematize the field by focusing on three critical, intersecting research areas: first, we provide a taxonomy of honeypot detection vectors, structuring the core problems that LLM-based realism must solve; second, we synthesize the emerging literature on LLM-powered honeypots, identifying a canonical architecture and key evaluation trends; and third, we chart the evolutionary path of honeypot log analysis, from simple data reduction to automated intelligence generation. We synthesize these findings into a forward-looking research roadmap, arguing that the true potential of this technology lies in creating autonomous, self-improving deception systems to counter the emerging threat of intelligent, automated attackers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25939v3\n    "}}

Achieving defect-free atom configurations is essential for high-fidelity quantum gates and scalable error correction, yet stochastic loading and atom loss during rearrangement hinder reliable large-scale assembly. This work presents ATLAS, an open-source atom transport algorithm that efficiently converts a randomly loaded $W \\times W$ lattice into a defect-free $L \\times L$ subarray while accounting for realistic physical constraints, including finite acceleration, transfer time, and per-move loss probability. In the planning phase, optimal batches of parallel moves are computed on a lossless virtual array; during execution, these moves are replayed under probabilistic atom loss to maximize the expected number of retained atoms. Monte Carlo simulations across lattice sizes $W=10$--$100$, loading probabilities $p_{\\mathrm{occ}}=0.5$--$0.9$, and loss rates $p_{\\mathrm{loss}}=0$--$0.05$ demonstrate fill rates above $99\\%$ within six iterations and over $90\\%$ atom retention at low loss. The algorithm achieves sublinear move scaling ($\\propto M^{0.55}$) and linear growth of required initial size with target dimension, outperforming prior methods in robustness and scalability -- offering a practical path toward larger neutral-atom quantum arrays.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16303v1\n    "}}

The reason is fairly straightforward: Networks will need to meet extreme service demands while remaining sustainable and traditional optimization techniques are too limited. With users moving, traffic swinging unpredictably and services pulling in different directions, management has to be adaptive and AI may offer a way forward. This survey looks at how well AI-based methods actually deliver on that promise. We organize the review around practical use cases. For each use case, we examine how AI techniques contribute to feedback-driven adaptability and rapid decision-making under dynamic conditions. We then evaluate them against seven central dynamic aspects that we consider unavoidable in 6G. The survey also discusses crucial tradeoffs between energy efficiency and the remaining 6G main objectives such as latency, reliability, fairness and coverage, and finally identifies gaps and future research directions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16296v1\n    "}}

Achieving in situ control of the coupling strength is essential for investigating how such hybridization evolves with the coupling strength. In this work, we use a symmetry-changing structural phase transition in lead halide perovskites to reversibly tune the phonon-photon coupling strength, leveraging the fact that their phonon frequencies and oscillator strengths are dictated by lattice symmetry. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of MAPbI3 embedded in nanoslot cavities reveals three polariton branches above the critical temperature Tc = 162.5 K, and the emergence of an additional branch below Tc, activated by a new phonon mode in the low-temperature phase. The full dispersion is accurately reproduced using a multimode Hopfield model, confirming that all normalized coupling strengths remain in the ultrastrong coupling regime. These results demonstrate symmetry-controlled tuning of ultrastrong coupling via phonon engineering in optical cavities.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16285v1\n    "}}

Furthermore, it inspires an efficient computational scheme for evaluating the entanglement entropy. We illustrate the method by calculating the von Neumann entropy of subsystems in toric codes and two types of quantum low-density-parity check codes, and by comparing the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy with respect to the subsystem size.

However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture \"template-over-safety flip\": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16278v1\n    "}}

Among them, a special role is played by quantum structures defined as networks of two-level systems. In this context, it has recently been shown that the energy stored in free fermion quantum batteries is sensitive to the quantum phase diagram of the battery itself. This sensitivity is relevant for stabilizing the stored energy and designing optimal charging protocols. In this article, we explore universal charging behaviors of free fermion quantum batteries across quantum phase transitions. We first analyze a Dirac cone-like model to extract general features. Then, we verify our findings by means of two relevant lattice models, namely the Ising chain in a transverse field and the Haldane model.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16274v1\n    "}}

For optimal efficiency, analyzing each subtask and scheduling it on the best-suited hardware would be necessary. Other considerations must be taken into account, too, such as parallelism, dependencies between different subtasks, and data transfer speeds between devices. To achieve this, directed acyclic graphs are often employed to represent these problems and enable utilizing as much hardware as possible on a given machine. In this paper, we present a software framework written in Julia capable of automatically and dynamically producing statically scheduled and compiled code. We lay theoretical foundations and add domain-specific information about the computation to the existing concepts of DAG scheduling, enabling optimizations that would otherwise be impossible. To illustrate the theory we implement an example application: the computation of matrix elements for scattering processes with many external particles in quantum electrodynamics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19456v1\n    "}}

The recently standardized Wireless Access Backhaul (WAB) architecture represents a key evolution, enabling cost-effective network densification through wireless relaying. This paper presents the first experimental realization of a multi-band WAB testbed, combining an FR2 backhaul and an FR1 access link using open-source software and commercial off-the-shelf components. The proposed framework validates the feasibility of end-to-end WAB operation and demonstrates its ability to extend FR2 coverage while maintaining compatibility with legacy FR1 user equipment. Experimental campaigns conducted in vehicular and outdoor-to-indoor scenarios confirm that WAB effectively mitigates the limitations of FR2 links, particularly in uplink and Non-Line-of-Sight conditions. These results highlight WAB as a practical and scalable approach for next-generation wireless networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16259v1\n    "}}

These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

In this short paper, we show how to reduce the range of the identifiers, in three different settings. More precisely, we show how to rename identifiers in the classical local certification setting, when we can (resp.\\ cannot) choose the new identifiers, and we show how a global certificate can help to encode very compactly a new identifier assignment that is not injective in general, but still useful in applications.\n  We conclude with a number of applications of these results: For every $\\ell$, there are local certification schemes for the properties of having clique number at most $\\ell$, having diameter at most $\\ell$, and having independence number at most~2, with certificates of size $O(n)$. We also show that there is a global certification scheme for bipartiteness with a certificate of size $O(n)$. All these results are optimal.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15404v3\n    "}}

Adversarial queries can successfully elicit these hidden instructions, posing significant security and privacy risks. Existing defense mechanisms frequently rely on heuristics, incur substantial computational overhead, or are inapplicable to models accessed via black-box APIs. This paper introduces a novel framework for hardening system prompts through shield appending, a lightweight approach that adds a protective textual layer to the original prompt. Our core contribution is the formalization of prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. We leverage an LLM-as-optimizer to search the space of possible SHIELDs, seeking to minimize a leakage metric derived from a suite of adversarial attacks, while simultaneously preserving task utility above a specified threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs. This black-box, optimization-driven methodology is lightweight and practical, requiring only API access to the target and optimizer LLMs. We demonstrate empirically that our optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against a comprehensive set of extraction attacks, outperforming established baseline defenses without compromising the model's intended functionality. Our work presents a paradigm for developing robust, utility-aware defenses in the escalating landscape of LLM security.

While hybrid parallelization strategies enable such pretraining, the vast combinatorial strategy space introduces significant optimization challenges. Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive tuning experiments, our framework systematically reveals the key factors influencing pretraining performance under different configurations, which provides solid a priori guidance for LLM pretraining system design and deployment.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09837v2\n    "}}

As such, their role as question answering chatbots raises significant concerns due to their shown vulnerability to adversarial man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Here, we propose the first principled attack evaluation on LLM factual memory under prompt injection via Xmera, our novel, theory-grounded MitM framework. By perturbing the input given to \"victim\" LLMs in three closed-book and fact-based QA settings, we undermine the correctness of the responses and assess the uncertainty of their generation process. Surprisingly, trivial instruction-based attacks report the highest success rate (up to ~85.3%) while simultaneously having a high uncertainty for incorrectly answered questions. To provide a simple defense mechanism against Xmera, we train Random Forest classifiers on the response uncertainty levels to distinguish between attacked and unattacked queries (average AUC of up to ~96%). We believe that signaling users to be cautious about the answers they receive from black-box and potentially corrupt LLMs is a first checkpoint toward user cyberspace safety.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05919v2\n    "}}

Monero stands out as a leading choice due to its strong privacy preserving and untraceability properties, making conventional blockchain analysis ineffective. Understanding the behavior and operational patterns of criminal actors within Monero is therefore challenging and it is essential to support future investigative strategies and disrupt illicit activities. In this work, we propose a case study in which we leverage a novel graph-based methodology to extract structural and temporal patterns from Monero transactions linked to already discovered criminal activities. By building Address-Ring-Transaction graphs from flagged transactions, we extract structural and temporal features and use them to train Machine Learning models capable of detecting similar behavioral patterns that could highlight criminal modus operandi.

However, the open wireless environment, dynamic topology, and resource constraints of UAVs expose low-altitude networks to severe DoS threats. Traditional defense approaches, which rely on fixed configurations or centralized decision-making, cannot effectively respond to the rapidly changing conditions in UAV swarm environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework for proactive DoS mitigation in low-altitude networks. Specifically, we design lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process, capturing the uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV is equipped with a policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy gradient-based algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their policies via reward-weighted aggregation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%, respectively, under various DoS attack strategies. These results highlight the potential of intelligent, distributed defense mechanisms to protect low-altitude networks, paving the way for reliable and scalable low-altitude economy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07392v4\n    "}}

While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration.\n  At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies.\n  Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads. The work positions feasibility-aware migration as a foundational building block for a future computing paradigm in which AI execution becomes fluid, geographically adaptive, and aligned with renewable energy availability.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16182v1\n    "}}

Traditional optimizations of the I/O stack aim to improve peak performance but are often workload specific and require deep expertise, making them difficult to generalize or re-use. In shared HPC environments, resource congestion can lead to unpredictable performance, causing slowdowns and timeouts. To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive approach based on Control Theory to dynamically regulate client-side I/O rates. Our approach leverages a small set of runtime system load metrics to reduce congestion and enhance performance stability. We implement a controller in a multi-node cluster and evaluate it on a real testbed under a representative workload. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates I/O congestion, reducing total runtime by up to 20% and lowering tail latency, while maintaining stable performance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16177v1\n    "}}

Safeguarding Open-Source LLMs Against Unauthorized Model Merging\n    summary: Model merging has emerged as an efficient technique for expanding large language models (LLMs) by integrating specialized expert models. However, it also introduces a new threat: model merging stealing, where free-riders exploit models through unauthorized model merging. Unfortunately, existing defense mechanisms fail to provide effective protection. Specifically, we identify three critical protection properties that existing methods fail to simultaneously satisfy: (1) proactively preventing unauthorized merging; (2) ensuring compatibility with general open-source settings; (3) achieving high security with negligible performance loss. To address the above issues, we propose MergeBarrier, a plug-and-play defense that proactively prevents unauthorized merging. The core design of MergeBarrier is to disrupt the Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) between the protected model and its homologous counterparts, thereby eliminating the low-loss path required for effective model merging. Extensive experiments show that MergeBarrier effectively prevents model merging stealing with negligible accuracy loss.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10712v2\n    "}}

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a prominent method for SCA, achieving state-of-the-art attack performance at the cost of interpretability. Understanding how neural networks extract secrets is crucial for security evaluators aiming to defend against such attacks, as only by understanding the attack can one propose better countermeasures.\n  In this work, we apply mechanistic interpretability to neural networks trained for SCA, revealing \\textit{how} models exploit \\textit{what} leakage in side-channel traces. We focus on sudden jumps in performance to reverse engineer learned representations, ultimately recovering secret masks and moving the evaluation process from black-box to white-box. Our results show that mechanistic interpretability can scale to realistic SCA settings, even when relevant inputs are sparse, model accuracies are low, and side-channel protections prevent standard input interventions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00384v3\n    "}}

By construction, the LLL algorithm deals with lattices living in a vector space endowed with a positive definite scalar product. However, it seems quite nature to ask about the indefinite case, where the scalar product is replaced by an arbitrary quadratic form, possibily indefinite. This question was considered independently in two lines of work. One by G{\u00e1}bor Ivanyos and {\u00c1}gnes Sz{\u00e1}nt{\u00f3} and one by Denis Simon. Both lead to an algorithm that generalizes LLL and whose performance is very similar to LLL, i.e. a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the shortest vector within an approximation factor exponential in the dimension. Denis Simon achieves an approximation factor close to that of LLL under the assumption that no isotropic vectors arise during reduction. G{\u00e1}bor Ivanyos and {\u00c1}gnes Sz{\u00e1}nt{\u00f3} show that it is possible to avoid isotropic vectors altogether, at the cost of a somewhat worse approximation factor.  In this paper, we revisit the reduction of indefinite lattices and conclude that it can lead to much better reduced representations that previously thought. We also conclude that the approximation factor depends on the signature of the indefinite lattice rather than on its dimension.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16151v1\n    "}}

In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercritical crossover to the quantum critical endpoint (QCEP), by studying the prototypical mixed-field quantum Ising and Potts models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities, near the QCEP. A supercritical scaling law, $h \\sim (g - g_c)^\u0394$, is found, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\u0394$ is the so-called gap exponent of the QCEP. Moreover, we demonstrate that the QSC crossover line acts as a boundary for the emergence of dynamical singularities in quench dynamics. This singularity manifests as a distinctive cusp with a critical exponent of 1/2, signaling a new dynamical universality class. We also propose utilizing Rydberg atom arrays as an experimental platform to observe these QSC crossovers and dynamical singularities. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the role of QCEP and associated supercritical crossovers in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05455v4\n    "}}

This is mainly due to the operational realizations of quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, to which the current classical encryption protocols are vulnerable. Blockchains, i.e., blockchain data structures and their data, rely heavily on classical cryptography. One approach to secure blockchain is to attempt to achieve information theoretical security by defining blockchain on quantum technologies. There have been two conceptualizations of blockchains on quantum registers: the time-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph blockchain. On our part, an attempt is made to conceptualize a new quantum blockchain combining features of both these schemes to achieve the absolute security of the time-temporal GHZ blockchain and the scalability and efficiency of the quantum hypergraph blockchain in the proposed quantum blockchain protocol.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14839v2\n    "}}

However, the real-world robustness of these defenses against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. We introduce Multi-Faceted Attack (MFA), a framework that systematically exposes general safety vulnerabilities in leading defense-equipped VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Llama-4. The core component of MFA is the Attention-Transfer Attack (ATA), which hides harmful instructions inside a meta task with competing objectives. We provide a theoretical perspective based on reward hacking to explain why this attack succeeds. To improve cross-model transferability, we further introduce a lightweight transfer-enhancement algorithm combined with a simple repetition strategy that jointly bypasses both input-level and output-level filters without model-specific fine-tuning. Empirically, we show that adversarial images optimized for one vision encoder transfer broadly to unseen VLMs, indicating that shared visual representations create a cross-model safety vulnerability. Overall, MFA achieves a 58.5% success rate and consistently outperforms existing methods. On state-of-the-art commercial models, MFA reaches a 52.8% success rate, surpassing the second-best attack by 34%. These results challenge the perceived robustness of current defense mechanisms and highlight persistent safety weaknesses in modern VLMs. Code: https://github.com/cure-lab/MultiFacetedAttack\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16110v1\n    "}}

In this paper, we propose a Bio-inspired Integrated Networking and Control (BINC) scheme, enabling efficient formation management for swarms comprising thousands of UAVs. The scheme forms a two-layer hierarchical structure, where network clusters and formations share the same groups so that cross-cluster control is eliminated. For networking, we design a fused routing message together with control information to reduce overhead, and limit clusters' size to local two-hop topologies for fast command transmission. For controlling, we develop a hybrid bio-inspired control approach, including a pigeon-like leader-follower algorithm within formations under the consideration of cluster topology maintenance, and a starling-like algorithm among formations that helps to improve the ability of obstacle avoidance. We establish a simulation platform for UAV swarms with over 1000 nodes, and experimental results show that the proposed BINC scheme can achieve highly maneuverable swarm formation marching with significant reduction on communication overhead.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16067v1\n    "}}

Current scheduling approaches often overlook or oversimplify PAT delays, leading to inefficient contact planning and overestimated network capacities. We present a validated model for quantifying retargeting delays, defined as the delay-inducing portion of PAT before data transmission begins, encompassing coarse pointing, fine pointing, and the handover to tracking. The model is grounded in mission data from NASA TBIRD, LLCD, DSOC, and ESA's Lunar Optical Communication Terminal. We find that PAT delays exhibit multimodal distributions based on prior link geometry and scale nonlinearly with initial pointing uncertainty and optical beam width. Integrating these delay models into routing and scheduling algorithms will enable more accurate contact planning and higher utilization in optical networks. The proposed model provides a foundation for evaluating performance and designing algorithms for future large-scale optical satellite networks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16063v1\n    "}}

They rely on fixed rules and predetermined signatures, making them blind to novel threats. We present a fundamentally different approach: instead of memorizing specific attack patterns, we learn what makes systems genuinely secure. Our key insight is simple yet powerful: context determines vulnerability. A SQL query that's safe in one environment becomes dangerous in another. By modeling this context-vulnerability relationship, we achieve something remarkable: our system detects attacks it has never seen before. We introduce context-aware verification that learns from genuine system behavior. Through reconstruction learning on secure systems, we capture their essential characteristics. When an unknown attack deviates from these patterns, our system recognizes it, even without prior knowledge of that specific attack type. We prove this capability theoretically, showing detection rates improve exponentially with context information I(W;C). Our framework combines three components: (1) reconstruction learning that models secure behavior, (2) multi-scale graph reasoning that aggregates contextual clues, and (3) attention mechanisms guided by reconstruction differences. Extensive experiments validate our approach: detection accuracy jumps from 58 percent to 82 percent with full context, unknown attack detection improves by 31 percent, and our system maintains above 90 percent accuracy even against completely novel attack vectors.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12440v2\n    "}}

Conventional approaches employ symmetric tile buffering, where the buffered tile size of the input $A$ along the dimension $M$ matches the output tile size of $C$.\n  In this paper, we introduce asymmetric tile buffering (ATB), a simple but powerful technique that decouples the buffered tile dimensions of the input and output operands. We show, for the first time, that ATB is both practical and highly beneficial. To explain this effect, we develop a performance model that incorporates both the benefits of ATB (higher arithmetic intensity) and its overheads (higher kernel switching costs), providing insight into how to select effective ATB tiling factors. As a case study, we apply ATB to AMD's latest XDNA2 AI Engine (AIE), achieving up to a 4.54x speedup, from 4.8 to 24.6 TFLOPS on mixed-precision BFP16--BF16 GEMM, establishing a new performance record for XDNA2 AIE.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16041v1\n    "}}

We introduce a post-quantum-secure evoting architecture that integrates Falcon lattice-based digital signatures, biometric authentication via MobileNetV3 and AdaFace, and a permissioned blockchain for tamper-proof vote storage. Voter registration involves capturing facial embeddings, which are digitally signed using Falcon and stored on-chain to ensure integrity and non-repudiation. During voting, real-time biometric verification is performed using anti-spoofing techniques and cosine-similarity matching. The system demonstrates low latency and robust spoof detection, monitored through Prometheus and Grafana for real-time auditing. The average classification error rates (ACER) are below 3.5% on the CelebA Spoof dataset and under 8.2% on the Wild Face Anti-Spoofing (WFAS) dataset. Blockchain anchoring incurs minimal gas overhead, approximately 3.3% for registration and 0.15% for voting, supporting system efficiency, auditability, and transparency. The experimental results confirm the system's scalability, efficiency, and resilience under concurrent loads. This approach offers a unified solution to address key challenges in voter authentication, data integrity, and quantum-resilient security for digital systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16034v1\n    "}}

However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \\textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \\textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \\textit{Bias Recommendation}, \\textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \\textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work.

On one hand, it is essential to allocate the limited onboard computational and communication resources efficiently to serve geographically distributed users. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of satellite orbits necessitates effective service migration strategies to maintain service continuity and quality as the coverage areas of satellites evolve. We formulate this problem as a spatio-temporal Markov decision process, where satellites, ground users, and flight users are modeled as nodes in a time-varying graph. The node features incorporate queuing dynamics to characterize packet loss probabilities. To solve this problem, we propose a Graph-Aware Temporal Encoder (GATE) that jointly models spatial correlations and temporal dynamics. GATE uses a two-layer graph convolutional network to extract inter-satellite and user dependencies and a temporal convolutional network to capture their short-term evolution, producing unified spatio-temporal representations. The resulting spatial-temporal representations are passed into a Hybrid Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework. This framework features a multi-head actor that outputs both discrete service migration decisions and continuous resource allocation ratios, along with a critic for value estimation. We conduct extensive simulations involving both persistent and intermittent users distributed across real-world population centers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16011v1\n    "}}

Existing research often relies on conspicuous overlays, elevated permissions, or unrealistic threat assumptions, limiting stealth and real-world feasibility. In this paper, we introduce a practical and stealthy jailbreak attack framework, which comprises three key components: (i) non-privileged perception compromise, which injects visual payloads into the application interface without requiring elevated system permissions; (ii) agent-attributable activation, which leverages input attribution signals to distinguish agent from human interactions and limits prompt exposure to transient intervals to preserve stealth from end users; and (iii) efficient one-shot jailbreak, a heuristic iterative deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs keyword-level detoxification to bypass built-in safety alignment of LVLMs. Moreover, we developed three representative Android applications and curated a prompt-injection dataset for mobile agents. We evaluated our attack across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and representative open-source models, and observed high planning and execution hijack rates (e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution), exposing a fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents and underscoring critical implications for autonomous smartphone operation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07809v2\n    "}}

The origin of these features is attributed to reorientational transitions (DeltaJ = 0; Q0-branch), which shift from the Rayleigh line as anisotropic intermolecular interactions lift the mJ degeneracy. This family of excitations closely follows the behavior of the S0-branches, sharing their dependence on pressure, temperature, and ortho-H2 concentration. Above 65 K, spectra corrected by the Bose-Einstein population factor reveal a broad continuum arising from populated higher J-states and increased ortho-para disorder. Upon entering phase III, where molecular rotation is inhibited, this continuum is quenched, giving way to well-established optical phonons. Below 25 K, equilibrated samples demonstrate a fine structure from isolated and pair excitations from impurity ortho-H2 molecules in a parahydrogen lattice, the latter a sensitive probe to anisotropic intermolecular interactions relevant to the quantum modeling of solid H2.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16010v1\n    "}}

In the quantum setting, a particularly challenging version of this considers adaptive reprogramming wherein the points to be reprogrammed (or the output values they should be programmed to) are dependent on choices made by the adversary. Some quantum frameworks for analyzing adaptive reprogramming were given by Unruh (CRYPTO 2014, EUROCRYPT 2015), Grilo-H\u00f6velmanns-H\u00fclsing-Majenz (ASIACRYPT 2021), and Pan-Zeng (PKC 2024). We show, counterintuitively, that these adaptive results follow from the \\emph{nonadaptive} one-way to hiding theorem of Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh (CRYPTO 2019). These implications contradict beliefs (whether stated explicitly or implicitly) that some properties of the adaptive frameworks cannot be provided by the Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh result.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16009v1\n    "}}

Existing methods for defending against jailbreak attacks are primarily based on auxiliary models. These strategies, however, often require extensive data collection or training. We propose LightDefense, a lightweight defense mechanism targeted at white-box models, which utilizes a safety-oriented direction to adjust the probabilities of tokens in the vocabulary, making safety disclaimers appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. We further innovatively leverage LLM's uncertainty about prompts to measure their harmfulness and adaptively adjust defense strength, effectively balancing safety and helpfulness. The effectiveness of LightDefense in defending against 5 attack methods across 2 target LLMs, without compromising helpfulness to benign user queries, highlights its potential as a novel and lightweight defense mechanism, enhancing security of LLMs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01533v2\n    "}}

This modern approach to agriculture generates a wealth of valuable data that could help address global food challenges, but farmers are hesitant to share it due to privacy concerns. This limits the extent to which researchers can learn from this data to inform improvements in farming. This paper presents the Digital Agriculture Sandbox, a secure online platform that solves this problem. The platform enables farmers (with limited technical resources) and researchers to collaborate on analyzing farm data without exposing private information. We employ specialized techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and data analysis methods to safeguard the data while maintaining its utility for research purposes. The system enables farmers to identify similar farmers in a simplified manner without needing extensive technical knowledge or access to computational resources. Similarly, it enables researchers to learn from the data and build helpful tools without the sensitive information ever leaving the farmer's system. This creates a safe space where farmers feel comfortable sharing data, allowing researchers to make important discoveries. Our platform helps bridge the gap between maintaining farm data privacy and utilizing that data to address critical food and farming challenges worldwide.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15990v1\n    "}}

We study these problems in the full-information model where despite decades of study, key gaps remain in our understanding of the trade-offs between round complexity, communication per player in each round, and adversarial resilience. We make progress by proving improved bounds for these problems.\n  We first show that any $k$-round coin flipping protocol over $\\ell$ players, each player sending one bit per round, can be biased by $O(\\ell/\\log^{(k)}(\\ell))$ bad players. We obtain a similar lower bound for leader election. This strengthens prior best bounds [RSZ, SICOMP 2002] of $O(\\ell/\\log^{(2k-1)}(\\ell))$ for coin flipping protocols and $O(\\ell/\\log^{(2k+1)}(\\ell))$ for leader election protocols. Our result implies that any (1-bit per player) protocol tolerating linear fraction of bad players requires at least $\\log^* \\ell$ rounds, showing existing protocols [RZ, JCSS 2001; F, FOCS 1999] are near-optimal.\n  We next initiate the study of one-round, (1-bit per player) random selection. We construct a protocol resilient to $\\ell / (\\log \\ell)^2$ bad players that outputs $(\\log \\ell)^2 / (\\log \\log \\ell)^2$ uniform random bits. This implies a one-round leader election protocol resilient to $\\ell / (\\log \\ell)^2$ bad players, improving the prior best protocol [RZ, JCSS 2001] which was resilient to $\\ell / (\\log \\ell)^3$ bad players. Our resilience matches that of the best one-round coin flipping protocol by Ajtai & Linial. We also obtain an almost matching lower bound: any protocol outputting $(\\log \\ell)^2 / (\\log \\log \\ell)^2$ bits can be corrupted by $\\ell (\\log \\log \\ell)^2 / (\\log \\ell)^2$ bad players. To obtain our lower bound, we introduce multi-output influence, an extension of influence of boolean functions to the multi-output setting.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01856v2\n    "}}

Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set.

Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15977v1\n    "}}

Conventional asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols require every party to broadcast its requests (e.g., transactions), and at the end of the protocol, parties agree on one party's request. If parties agree on one party's requests while exchanging every party's request, the protocol becomes expensive. These protocols are used to design an atomic broadcast (ABC) protocol where parties agree on $\\langle n-f \\rangle$ parties' requests (assuming $n=3f+1$, where $n$ is the total number of parties, and $f$ is the number of Byzantine parties). Although the parties agree on a subset of requests in the ABC protocol, if the requests do not vary (are duplicated), investing in a costly protocol is not justified. We propose Slim-HBBFT, an atomic broadcast protocol that considers requests from a fraction of $n$ parties and improves communication complexity by a factor of $O(n)$. At the core of our design is a prioritized provable-broadcast (P-PB) protocol that generates proof of broadcast only for selected parties. We use the P-PB protocol to design the Slim-HBBFT atomic broadcast protocol. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis to demonstrate that Slim-HBBFT satisfies the properties of the Asynchronous Common Subset protocol, ensuring robust security and reliability.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15957v1\n    "}}

By decoupling data dissemination from transaction ordering and constructing a well-connected DAG in the mempool, these protocols enable zero-message ordering and implicit view changes. However, we identify a fundamental liveness vulnerability: an adversary can trigger mempool explosions to prevent transaction commitment, ultimately compromising the protocol's liveness.\n  In response, this work presents Lifefin, a generic and self-stabilizing protocol designed to integrate seamlessly with existing DAG-based BFT protocols and circumvent such vulnerabilities. Lifefin leverages the Agreement on Common Subset (ACS) mechanism, allowing nodes to escape mempool explosions by committing transactions with bounded resource usage even in adverse conditions. As a result, Lifefin imposes (almost) zero overhead in typical cases while effectively eliminating liveness vulnerabilities.\n  To demonstrate the effectiveness of Lifefin, we integrate it into two state-of-the-art DAG-based BFT protocols, Sailfish and Mysticeti, resulting in two enhanced variants: Sailfish-Lifefin and Mysticeti-Lifefin. We implement these variants and compare them with the original Sailfish and Mysticeti systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that Lifefin achieves comparable transaction throughput while introducing only minimal additional latency to resist similar attacks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15936v1\n    "}}

This raises concerns about provenance, ownership, and integrity. Watermarking can help address these issues by embedding metadata directly into the content. To work well, a watermark needs enough capacity for meaningful metadata. It must also stay imperceptible and remain robust to common video manipulations. Existing methods struggle with limited capacity, extra inference cost, or reduced visual quality. We introduce VidStamp, a watermarking framework that embeds frame-level messages through the decoder of a latent video diffusion model. The decoder is fine-tuned in two stages. The first stage uses static image datasets to encourage spatial message separation. The second stage uses synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency. This approach enables high-capacity watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. VidStamp also supports dynamic watermarking through a control signal that selects message templates during inference. This adds flexibility and creates a second channel for communication. We evaluate VidStamp on Stable Video Diffusion (I2V), OpenSora, and Wan (T2V). The system embeds 48 bits per frame while preserving visual quality and staying robust to common distortions. Compared with VideoSeal, VideoShield, and RivaGAN, it achieves lower log P-values and stronger detectability. Its frame-wise watermarking design also enables precise temporal tamper localization, with an accuracy of 0.96, which exceeds the VideoShield baseline.

These factors jointly affect system Cost, Accuracy, and Performance (CAP), making trade-offs inevitable. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture these trade-offs accurately, complicating practical deployment decisions. To address this, we introduce MoE-CAP, a benchmark specifically designed for MoE systems. Our analysis reveals that achieving an optimal balance across CAP is difficult with current hardware; MoE systems typically optimize two of the three dimensions at the expense of the third-a dynamic we term the MoE-CAP trade-off. To visualize this, we propose the CAP Radar Diagram. We further introduce sparsity-aware performance metrics-Sparse Memory Bandwidth Utilization (S-MBU) and Sparse Model FLOPS Utilization (S-MFU)-to enable accurate performance benchmarking of MoE systems across diverse hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07067v6\n    "}}

Let $P_\u03bd$ be the projection to $\\mathcal{H}_\u03bd$. It was recently shown that for all Hamiltonians with no highly degenerate eigenvalues and gaps most $\u03c8_0\\in\\mathcal{H}_\u03bc$ are such that for most $t\\geq 0$, $\\|P_\u03bd\u03c8_t\\|^2$ is close to a $t$- and $\u03c8_0$-independent value $M_{\u03bc\u03bd}$ provided that $M_{\u03bc\u03bd}$ is not too small. Here, ``most'' refers to the uniform distribution on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}(\\mathcal{H}_\u03bc)$. In the present work, we generalize this result from the uniform distribution, corresponding to the micro-canonical ensemble, to the much more general class of Gaussian adjusted projected (GAP) measures. For any density matrix $\u03c1$ on $\\mathcal{H}$, $\\mathrm{GAP}(\u03c1)$ is the most spread out distribution on $\\mathbb{S}(\\mathcal{H})$ with density matrix $\u03c1$. We show that also for $\\mathrm{GAP}(\u03c1)$-most $\u03c8_0\\in\\mathcal{H}$ for most $t\\geq 0$, $\\|P_\u03bd\u03c8_t\\|^2$ is close to a fixed value $M_{\u03c1P_\u03bd}$ (which must not be too small). Moreover, we prove a generalization for certain operators $B$ instead of $P_\u03bd$ and for finite times. Since certain GAP measures are quantum analogs of the (grand-)canonical ensemble, our result expresses a version of equivalence of ensembles.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16666v2\n    "}}

We prove these analogs for several large classes, including (a) constant $F$-isocrystals, (b) direct sums of isoclinic convergent $F$-isocrystals, (c) semi-simple overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, and (d) semi-simple convergent $F$-isocrystals which have an overconvergent extension. Case (a) is a generalization of the Mordell-Lang Conjecture for tori and enters in the proofs of (b) and (c). For (b) we use the classical Chebotar\u00ebv Density Theorem, and point counting techniques in $p$-adic Lie groups building on a result of Oesterl\u00e9. For (c) we give two proofs. One of them uses deep input on the Langlands correspondence by Abe and Lafforgue, and the theory of Frobenius weights of Kedlaya, Abe and Caro. Building on this we formulate and prove the $p$-adic analog of Deligne's Equidistribution Theorem. Then (c) follows by applying real algebraic geometry to maximal compact subgroups in complex algebraic groups, measure theory, and a convergence result on complex hypersurfaces. For (d) we develop the theory of maximal quasi-tori (generalizing maximal tori in non-connected linear algebraic groups) and use D'Addezio's result on Crew's parabolicity conjecture to reduce to (b).

Originating from the seminal work of Cachin et al. \\cite{CACHIN01}, subsequent research endeavors have sought to optimize protocol efficiency in terms of communication complexity. Notable advancements following Cachin's contributions include: i) VABA \\cite{BYZ17}, requiring multiple protocol instances to achieve agreement on a party's request, and ii) Dumbo-MVBA \\cite{LU20}, employing a cryptographic asynchronous dispersal and recovery methods to manage communication complexity alongside additional computational and communication rounds overheads.\n  Our objective is to devise an MVBA protocol that achieves agreement in each instance without extra computation and communication rounds while maintaining the optimal metrics. Central to our design approach is the introduction of the committee in the classic MVBA protocol, wherein a randomly selected subset of ($f+1$, where $n=3f+1$) parties get selected and simultaneously broadcast their requests (transactions) to gather verifiable proofs. Successive distributions of these proofs afford us the necessary properties to employ the asynchronous binary Byzantine agreement (ABBA) protocol for reaching an agreement on a selected party's requests. By integrating the committee and ABBA protocols, we devise the optimal MVBA protocol, termed pMVBA (Prioritized-MVBA). This protocol exhibits resilience to tolerate up to $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3}\\rfloor$ Byzantine failures, with an expected runtime of $O(1)$, optimal message complexity of $O(n^2)$, and optimal communication complexity $O((l+\u03bb)n^2)$ .\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03739v2\n    "}}

Current inter-satellite link (ISL) layouts have rarely been optimized to minimize network diameter while simultaneously satisfying physical and operational constraints, including maximum link distance, line-of-sight, per-satellite hardware limits, and long-term link viability over orbital periods. In this study, the selection and assignment of inter-plane ISLs is formulated as a diameter-minimization problem on a Starlink-inspired Walker-Delta constellation in which each satellite is equipped with two fixed intra-plane links and may activate up to two inter-plane links. Beginning with a feasible baseline, the topology is iteratively refined by a local-search procedure that replaces or reinforces links to shrink the diameter. The resulting ISL configuration meets all geometric and hardware limits, preserves link stability across multiple orbital periods, and yields a sparse, diameter-aware graph with potential for centralized routing capabilities. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves low worst-case latency without compromising ISL stability, and the trade-off between hop count and long-term link stability is empirically measured for guidance of future LEO network deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15861v1\n    "}}

Computing this model is a central problem in arithmetic geometry. For non-hyperelliptic genus $3$ curves, which are canonically embedded as plane quartics, methods like admissible reduction become challenging in small residue characteristics. This thesis establishes a precise connection between the abstractly defined stable model and computationally accessible GIT-stable plane models. We prove that a GIT-stable plane model of a smooth plane quartic exists if and only if its stable reduction is non-hyperelliptic. When this condition holds, we show that the stable model is the unique minimal semistable model that dominates the GIT-stable model. The corresponding domination morphism is geometrically explicit: it contracts the $1$-tails of the stable reduction to cusps on the special fiber of the GIT-stable model and is an immersion elsewhere. This result provides a geometric framework for computing the stable model by first finding a GIT-stable model and then resolving its cuspidal singularities.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15858v1\n    "}}

Traditional Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) exhibit cubic O(n^3) complexity, rendering real-time privilege analysis intractable at enterprise scale. We present a novel PAM framework integrating NIST's Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) with hypergraph semantics to address this scalability crisis. Our approach leverages hypergraphs with labeled hyperedges to model complex, multi-dimensional privilege relationships, achieving sub-linear O(sqrt n) traversal complexity and O(nlogn) detection time-rigorously proven through formal complexity analysis. We introduce a 3-Dimensional Privilege Analysis framework encompassing Attack Surface, Attack Window, and Attack Identity to systematically identify privilege vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on AWS-based systems with 200-4000 users demonstrates 10x improvement over ABAC and 4x improvement over standard NGAC-DAG, enabling sub-second privilege detection at scale. Real-world use cases validate detection of privilege escalation chains, over-privileged users, and lateral movement pathways in multi-cloud infrastructures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15837v1\n    "}}

MonadBFT is implemented as the consensus protocol in the Monad blockchain. As a HotStuff-family protocol, MonadBFT has linear message complexity in the common case and is optimistically responsive, operating as quickly as the network allows. A central feature of MonadBFT is its tail-forking resistance. In pipelined BFT protocols, when a leader goes offline, the previous proposal is abandoned. Malicious leaders can exploit this tail-forking behavior as a form of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attack by deliberately discarding their predecessor's block, depriving that proposer of rewards and enabling transaction reordering, censorship or theft. MonadBFT prevents such tail-forking attacks, preserving both fairness and integrity in transaction execution. Another related feature of MonadBFT is its notion of speculative finality, which enables parties to execute ordered transactions after a single round (i.e., a single view), with reverts occurring only in the rare case of provable leader equivocation. This mechanism reduces user-perceived latency. Additionally, we introduce the leader fault isolation property, which ensures that the protocol can quickly recover from a failure. To our knowledge, no prior pipelined, leader-based BFT consensus protocol combines all of these properties in a single design.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20692v2\n    "}}

Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \\textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved. Our results indicate that the HL can be approached in quantum gravimetry using realistic experimental parameters for systems with $L=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $N\\gg L$.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15805v1\n    "}}

Automorphism of gauge group naturally gives global symmetries of gauge theories. In this work we study such symmetries in gauge theories induced by automorphisms of the gauge group, when the gauge theories have nontrivial topological actions in different spacetime dimensions. We discover the automorphism symmetry can be extended, become a higher group symmetry, and/or become a non-invertible symmetry. We illustrate the discussion with various models in field theory and on the lattice. In particular, we use automorphism symmetry to construct new transversal non-Clifford logical gates in topological quantum codes. In particular, we show that 2+1d $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford stabilizer models can implement non-Clifford transversal logical gate in the 4th level $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford hierarchy for $N\\geq 3$, extending the generalized Bravyi-K\u00f6nig bound proposed in the companion paper [arXiv:2511.02900] for qubits.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15783v1\n    "}}

A finite-entanglement scaling analysis at $\u03bb= 0.8$ bounds the critical mass-squared to $\u03bc_c^2 \\in [-0.3190,-0.3185]$ and provides a quantitative map of the symmetric, near-critical, weakly broken, and deeply broken regimes. Using these ground states as asymptotic vacua, we simulate two-particle collisions in a sandwich geometry and extract the elastic scattering probability $P_{11\\to 11}(E)$ and Wigner time delay $\u0394t(E)$ following the prescription of Jha et al. [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 023266 (2025)].

Studies have highlighted the risk of information leakage, where adversaries can extract sensitive information embedded in the prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel private prediction framework for generating high-quality synthetic text with strong privacy guarantees. Our approach leverages the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to ensure worst-case theoretical bounds on information leakage without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying models. The proposed method performs inference on private records and aggregates the resulting per-token output distributions. This enables the generation of longer and coherent synthetic text while maintaining privacy guarantees. Additionally, we propose a simple blending operation that combines private and public inference to further enhance utility. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, making it a promising direction for privacy-preserving text generation while maintaining high utility.

This letter proposes a Dual-domain Feature Importance Attack (DuFIA) scheme to invalidate AIGI detectors to some extent. Forensically important features are captured by the spatially interpolated gradient and frequency-aware perturbation. The adversarial transferability is enhanced by jointly modeling spatial and frequency-domain feature importances, which are fused to guide the optimization-based adversarial example generation. Extensive experiments across various AIGI detectors verify the cross-model transferability, transparency and robustness of DuFIA.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15571v1\n    "}}

At present, there are a handful of technologically mature systems which produce data streams with diverse output formats. In the near future it is anticipated there will be vendors who offer new sensor hardware which could also yield unique data schema that are not aligned to past efforts. Thus, due to the relative nascent nature of the technology and its potential for widespread use in a variety of applications, it is an opportune time to define a standard for this class of sensors' output data. The intent of this document is to identify and provide a standard for the collected EBS streaming data. The main objective of the standard is to be sensor agnostic, incorporate some of the current sensor configurations and modalities, and account for the developing configurations and modalities. The intent is also to leave enough place holders and space in the standard for future variations that may develop as EBS technology matures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15556v1\n    "}}

Supporting emerging third-party applications calls for a general-purpose, queryable onboard storage system. Yet today's data loggers and storage stacks in vehicles fail to deliver efficient data storage and retrieval. This paper presents AVS, an Autonomous Vehicle Storage system that co-designs computation with a hierarchical layout: modality-aware reduction and compression, hot-cold tiering with daily archival, and a lightweight metadata layer for indexing. The design is grounded with system-level benchmarks on AV data that cover SSD and HDD filesystems and embedded indexing, and is validated on embedded hardware with real L4 autonomous driving traces. The prototype delivers predictable real-time ingest, fast selective retrieval, and substantial footprint reduction under modest resource budgets. The work also outlines observations and next steps toward more scalable and longer deployments to motivate storage as a first-class component in AV stacks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19453v1\n    "}}

Adaptive routing algorithms route packets over different available paths to reduce latency and improve network utilization. However, if a switch routes packets belonging to the same network flow on different paths, they might arrive at the destination out-of-order due to differences in the latency of these paths. For some transport protocols like TCP, QUIC, and RoCE, out-of-order (OOO) packets might cause large performance drops or significantly increase CPU utilization. In this work, we propose flowcut switching, a new adaptive routing algorithm that provides high-performance in-order packet delivery. Differently from existing solutions like flowlet switching, which are based on the assumption of bursty traffic and that might still reorder packets, flowcut switching guarantees in-order delivery under any network conditions, and is effective also for non-bursty traffic, as it is often the case for RDMA.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21406v2\n    "}}

The algorithm is applicable to problems with strongly coupled, or non-Markovian, environments, problems with multiple environments out of mutual equilibrium, and problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the algorithm can reproduce the true dynamics of such problems at arbitrary accuracy and, for a broad range of problems, only adds a minor resource cost relative to Trotterized time evolution; the cost is low-degree polynomial in the inverse target accuracy. The algorithm is based on the insight that any Gaussian environment can be represented as a train of ancillary qubits that sequentially interact with the system through a time-local coupling, given by the convolution square root of the bath correlation function; this is a secondary result of our work.

Yet state-of-the-art designs lack a principled and efficient way to exchange blocks, which leaves them open to targeted attacks and performance collapse under network asynchrony. This work introduces the concept of a block synchronizer, a simple abstraction that drives incremental block retrieval and enforces resource-aware exchange. Its interface and role fit cleanly inside a modern BFT consensus stack. We also uncover a new attack, where an adversary steers honest validators into redundant, uncoordinated pulls that exhaust bandwidth and stall progress. Beluga is a modular and scarcity-aware instantiation of the block synchronizer. It achieves optimal common-case latency while bounding the cost of recovery under faults and adversarial behavior. We integrate Beluga into Mysticeti, the consensus core of the Sui blockchain, and show on a geo-distributed AWS deployment that Beluga sustains optimal performance in the optimistic path and, under attack, delivers up to 3x higher throughput and 25x lower latency than prior designs. The Sui blockchain adopted Beluga in production.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15517v1\n    "}}

However, Host processors and PIM cores require different data layouts: Hosts need consecutive elements distributed across DRAM banks, while PIM cores need them within local banks. This necessitates data rearrangements in ML kernel execution that pose significant performance and programmability challenges, further exacerbated by the need to support diverse PIM backends. Current compilation approaches lack systematic optimization for diverse ML kernels across multiple PIM backends and may largely ignore data rearrangements during compute code optimization. We demonstrate that data rearrangements and compute code optimization are interdependent, and need to be jointly optimized during the tuning process. To address this, we design DCC, the first data-centric ML compiler for PIM systems that jointly co-optimizes data rearrangements and compute code in a unified tuning process. DCC integrates a multi-layer PIM abstraction that enables various data distribution and processing strategies on different PIM backends. DCC enables effective co-optimization by mapping data partitioning strategies to compute loop partitions, applying PIM-specific code optimizations and leveraging a fast and accurate performance prediction model to select optimal configurations.

However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.\n  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to \"consider the right questions\" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15763v1\n    "}}

In this framework, nodes are assigned labels, called certificates, which are supposed to prove that the property holds. The nodes then communicate with their neighbors to verify the correctness of these certificates.\n  Certifying that there is a unique leader in a network is one of the most classical problems in this setting. It is well-known that this can be done using certificates that encode node identifiers and distances in the graph. These require $O(\\log n)$ and $O(\\log D)$ bits respectively, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter. A matching lower bound is known in cycle graphs (where $n$ and $D$ are equal up to multiplicative constants).\n  A recent line of work has shown that network structure greatly influences local certification. For example, certifying that a network does not contain triangles takes $\u0398(n)$ bits in general graphs, but only $O(\\log n)$ bits in graphs of bounded treewidth. This observation raises the question: Is it possible to achieve sublogarithmic leader certification in graph classes that do not contain cycle graphs? And since in that case we cannot write identifiers in a certificate, do we actually need identifiers at all in such topologies? [We answer these questions with results on small diameter graphs, chordal graphs, grids, and dense graphs. See full abstract in the paper.]\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15491v1\n    "}}

In this paper, we demonstrate how a reinforcement learning (RL) agent can learn a new class of attack algorithms that generate adversarial samples. Unlike traditional adversarial machine learning (AML) methods that craft adversarial samples independently, our RL-based approach retains and exploits past attack experience to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of future attacks. We formulate adversarial sample generation as a Markov Decision Process and evaluate RL's ability to (a) learn effective and efficient attack strategies and (b) compete with state-of-the-art AML. On two image classification benchmarks, our agent increases attack success rate by up to 13.2% and decreases the average number of victim model queries per attack by up to 16.9% from the start to the end of training. In a head-to-head comparison with state-of-the-art image attacks, our approach enables an adversary to generate adversarial samples with 17% more success on unseen inputs post-training. From a security perspective, this work demonstrates a powerful new attack vector that uses RL to train agents that attack ML models efficiently and at scale.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01734v2\n    "}}

Software vulnerabilities can severely impact safety, the economy, and society. In response to this challenge, Strandberg et al. [escar Europe, 2021] introduced the Unified Software Update Framework (UniSUF), designed to provide a secure update framework that integrates seamlessly with existing vehicular infrastructures.\n  Although UniSUF has previously been evaluated regarding cybersecurity, these assessments have not employed formal verification methods. To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15479v1\n    "}}

However, the transmission of quantum states through the Earth's atmosphere is highly susceptible to noise, restricting its application primarily to nighttime. High-dimensional (HD) QKD offers a promising solution to this limitation by employing high-dimensionally entangled quantum states. Although experimental platforms for HD QKD exist, previous security analyses have been limited to the asymptotic regime and have either relied on impractical measurements or employed computationally demanding convex optimization tasks restricting the security analysis to low dimensions. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting a composable finite-size security proof against both collective and coherent attacks for a general HD QKD protocol that uses only experimentally accessible measurements. In addition to the conventional, yet impractical `one-shot' key rates, we provide a practical variable-length security argument that yields significantly higher expected key rates. This approach is particularly crucial under rapidly changing and turbulent atmospheric conditions, as encountered in free-space and satellite-based QKD platforms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03874v2\n    "}}

However, routing cryptographic keys across multi-hop quantum networks introduces challenges unique to quantum communication. This survey analyzes and classifies 26 routing strategies proposed between 2013 and 2024 for terrestrial, satellite, and hybrid QKD infrastructures. Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25-40% compared to static shortest-path methods by incorporating real-time key pool availability and link error rates. Multi-path strategies improve resilience against trusted-node compromise by distributing keys across disjoint routes, albeit with an increase in key consumption of 30-60%. SDN-based orchestration frameworks emerge as essential enablers of flexible, QoS-aware routing for hybrid networks integrating terrestrial fibers and intermittent satellite links. Critical research directions include reducing dependence on trusted nodes through quantum repeaters or post-quantum cryptography, developing standardized key management interfaces for interoperability, and adopting AI-driven predictive routing for adapting to fluctuating network states. This comprehensive synthesis of routing algorithms, performance trade-offs, and unresolved issues offers practical guidance for engineering secure, adaptable, and large-scale QKD networks capable of meeting real-world deployment demands.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15465v1\n    "}}

In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.\n  We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).\n  We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs. Our empirical findings demonstrate that the evasive strategies we define are widespread and operationally significant.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15463v1\n    "}}

In 2014 a model was proposed representing all neurons and synapses of the stereotypical cortical microcircuit below $1\\,\\text{mm}^2$ of brain surface. The model reproduces fundamental features of brain activity but its impact remained limited because of its computational demands. For theory and simulation, however, the model was a breakthrough because it removes uncertainties of downscaling, and larger models are less densely connected. This sparked a race in the neuromorphic computing community and the model became a de facto standard benchmark. Within a few years real-time performance was reached and surpassed at significantly reduced energy consumption. We review how the computational challenge was tackled by different simulation technologies and derive guidelines for the next generation of benchmarks and other domains of science.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21185v3\n    "}}

Empirical evidence shows that its time evolution is non-continuous, probabilistic, and self-regulated. Block discovery follows a stochastic process in which uncertainty accumulates during the search phase and collapses abruptly when a valid proof-of-work solution appears. Difficulty adjustment maintains the system near the entropy-maximizing regime and allows the network to infer the underlying global hash rate. Building on these observations, we present a unified framework in which Bitcoin time emerges from four interacting mechanisms: proof of work as a distributed entropy source, difficulty adjustment as temporal feedback, entropy collapse as discrete temporal updates, and recursive sealing through hash pointers. Together these mechanisms form a self-regulating temporal architecture that transforms distributed randomness into a coherent and irreversible global timeline, offering a generalizable foundation for autonomous timekeeping in permissionless systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11091v11\n    "}}

Traditional machine learning approaches for phishing detection often require extensive feature engineering, continuous retraining, and costly infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, proprietary large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in phishing-related classification tasks, but their operational costs and reliance on external providers limit their practical adoption in many business environments. This paper investigates the feasibility of small language models (SLMs) for detecting phishing websites using only their raw HTML code. A key advantage of these models is that they can be deployed on local infrastructure, providing organisations with greater control over data and operations. We systematically evaluate 15 commonly used Small Language Models (SLMs), ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, benchmarking their classification accuracy, computational requirements, and cost-efficiency. Our results highlight the trade-offs between detection performance and resource consumption, demonstrating that while SLMs underperform compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs, they can still provide a viable and scalable alternative to external LLM services. By presenting a comparative analysis of costs and benefits, this work lays the foundation for future research on the adaptation, fine-tuning, and deployment of SLMs in phishing detection systems, aiming to balance security effectiveness and economic practicality.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15434v1\n    "}}

To defend against such security breaches, researchers have focused on building sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Although these algorithms notably improve detection performance, they require excessive computing power and resources, which are crucial issues in IoT networks considering the recent trends of decentralized data processing and computing systems. Consequently, many optimization techniques have been incorporated with these ML models. Specifically, a special category of optimizer adopted from the behavior of living creatures and different aspects of natural phenomena, known as metaheuristic algorithms, has been a central focus in recent years and brought about remarkable results. Considering this vital significance, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of various applications of metaheuristics algorithms in developing a machine learning-based IDS, especially for IoT. A significant contribution of this study is the discovery of hidden correlations between these optimization techniques and machine learning models integrated with state-of-the-art IoT-IDSs. In addition, the effectiveness of these metaheuristic algorithms in different applications, such as feature selection, parameter or hyperparameter tuning, and hybrid usages are separately analyzed. Moreover, a taxonomy of existing IoT-IDSs is proposed. Furthermore, we investigate several critical issues related to such integration. Our extensive exploration ends with a discussion of promising optimization algorithms and technologies that can enhance the efficiency of IoT-IDSs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00377v3\n    "}}

Value-Dependent Block Confirmation to Determine Transaction Finalit\n    summary: We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15421v1\n    "}}

However, the fundamental networking layer that sustains these systems, the peer-to-peer layer, of all but the top few ecosystems remains largely opaque. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal, cross-network measurement study of 36 public blockchain networks. Over 9 months, we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted hourly connectivity probes to observe the evolving state of these networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum's discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional 19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide scans, which only require probing each protocol's default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly.\n  Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability. Beyond characterizing each network, our methodology demonstrates a general framework for measuring decentralized networks at scale. This opens the door for continued monitoring, benchmarking, and more transparent assessments of blockchain infrastructure across diverse ecosystems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15388v1\n    "}}

To address this issue, a quantum backdoor attack detection framework called QSentry is proposed, in which a quantum Measurement Clustering method is introduced to detect backdoors by identifying statistical anomalies in measurement outputs. It is demonstrated that QSentry can effectively detect anomalous distributions induced by backdoor samples with extensive experiments. It achieves a 75.8% F1 score even under a 1% poisoning rate, and further improves to 85.7% and 93.2% as the poisoning rate increases to 5% and 10%, respectively. The integration of silhouette coefficients and relative cluster size enable QSentry to precisely isolate backdoor samples, yielding estimates that closely match actual poisoning ratios. Evaluations under various quantum attack scenarios demonstrate that QSentry delivers superior robustness and accuracy compared with three state-of-the-art detection methods. This work establishes a practical and effective framework for mitigating backdoor threats in QML.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15376v1\n    "}}

However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715v2\n    "}}

High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f<3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations). Together, these layers enable optimistic sub-second finality at high throughput while maintaining strong safety and liveness under a mild synchrony assumption.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15361v1\n    "}}

Specifically, we demonstrate that a tilted potential interface causes electron wave packets to undergo a refraction-like deflection upon transmission through the barrier, leading to a finite transverse current and a corresponding Hall conductance. Our analytical framework captures the essential features of this refraction Hall effect, and the resulting Hall conductivity profile is corroborated by numerical simulations across different lattice models and device geometries. We further visualize our predicted effect through real-time wave packet dynamics, which reveals its purely geometric origin and the robustness of the transverse response. These findings establish a fundamentally distinct class of Hall-like transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems that preserve time-reversal symmetry.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15337v1\n    "}}

In campus networks, the ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) service category is of major interest for applications with strict latency and high-reliability requirements. One way to achieve high reliability in a shared infrastructure is through resource isolation, whereby network slicing can be optimized to adequately reserve computation and transmission capacity. This paper proposes an approach for vertical slicing the radio access network (RAN) to enable the deployment of multiple and isolated campus networks to accommodate URLLC services. To this end, we model RAN function placement as a mixed integer linear programming problem with URLLC-related constraints. We demonstrate that our approach can find optimal solutions in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, unlike existing solutions, our model considers the user traffic flow from a known source node on the network's edge to an unknown \\textit{a priori} destination node. This flexibility could be explored in industrial campus networks by allowing dynamic placement of user plane functions (UPFs) to serve the URLLC.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15429v2\n    "}}

Traditional approaches often rely on centralized orchestration to partition tasks among nodes. However, these methods struggle with communication bottlenecks, latency, and reliability when the swarm grows or the topology shifts rapidly. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully distributed, diffusive metric-based approach for split computing in UAV swarms. Our solution introduces a new iterative measure, termed the aggregated gigaflops, capturing each node's own computing capacity along with that of its neighbors without requiring global network knowledge. By forwarding partial inferences intelligently to underutilized nodes, we achieve improved task throughput, lower latency, and enhanced energy efficiency. Further, to handle sudden workload surges and rapidly changing node conditions, we incorporate an early-exit mechanism that can adapt the inference pathway on-the-fly. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline strategies across multiple performance indices, including latency, fairness, and energy consumption.

To meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, existing LLM serving systems disaggregate the prefill and decode phases of inference. However, decode instances often experience low GPU utilization due to their memory-bound nature and insufficient batching in dynamic workloads, leaving compute resources underutilized.\n  We introduce Harli, a serving system that improves GPU utilization by co-locating parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) tasks with LLM decode instances. PEFT tasks are compute-bound and memory-efficient, making them ideal candidates for safe co-location. Specifically, Harli addresses key challenges--limited memory and unpredictable interference--using three components: a unified memory allocator for runtime memory reuse, a two-stage latency predictor for decode latency modeling, and a QoS-guaranteed throughput-maximizing scheduler for throughput maximization. Experimental results show that Harli improves the finetune throughput by 46.2% on average (up to 92.0%) over state-of-the-art serving systems, while maintaining strict QoS guarantees for inference decode.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11729v2\n    "}}

We demonstrate an experimental method to engineer the transduction of microwave driving into heat flow through a leaky resonator. Given the precise conversion, a qubit receiving the heat flow obtains a quasi-thermal equilibrium with arbitrary target temperature in hundreds of nanoseconds. We show that the dynamics of the quantum transducing process is described by thermalizing channel states, generated from the double dressings of the resonator by the semi-classical driving and the qubit-resonator coupling. Their spectrum, coupling, and driving strength determine the channel rate of energy flow, along with the relaxation rates of photon leakage into the bath. The analytical prediction is shown to match well with the experimental measurements on an Xmon qubit circuit.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15314v1\n    "}}

Our benchmark includes 847 adversarial test cases across five attack categories: direct injection, context manipulation, instruction override, data exfiltration, and cross-context contamination. We evaluate three defense mechanisms: content filtering with embedding-based anomaly detection, hierarchical system prompt guardrails, and multi-stage response verification, across seven state-of-the-art language models. Our combined framework reduces successful attack rates from 73.2% to 8.7% while maintaining 94.3% of baseline task performance.

While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15278v1\n    "}}

Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15272v1\n    "}}

Most existing methods solve these problems separately and depend on limited task-specific signals, which limits generalization and interpretability. We present PLATONT, a unified framework that models different network indicators (e.g., delay, loss, bandwidth) as projections of a shared latent network state. Guided by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, PLATONT learns this latent state through multimodal alignment and contrastive learning. By training multiple tomography tasks within a shared latent space, it builds compact and structured representations that improve cross-task generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that PLATONT consistently outperforms existing methods in link estimation, topology inference, and traffic prediction, achieving higher accuracy and stronger robustness under varying network conditions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15251v1\n    "}}

Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved.

We show that these logical gates can be expressed as exponential of polynomial functions of the electric and magnetic gauge fields, which allows us to derive explicit decompositions into physical gates. We further prove that their logical action depends only on the (co)homology classes of the corresponding logical qubits, establishing consistency as logical operations. Our results provide a systematic method for formulating logical gates for general CSS codes, offering new insights into the interplay between quantum error correction, algebraic topology, and quantum field theory.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15224v1\n    "}}

This article presents a unified perspective on cross-domain vulnerabilities that arise across integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), federated learning (FL), digital twins (DTs), diffusion models (DMs), and large telecommunication models (LTMs). We highlight emerging adversarial agents such as compromised DTs and LTMs that can manipulate both the physical and cognitive layers of 6G systems. To address these risks, we propose an adaptive evolutionary defense (AED) concept that continuously co-evolves with attacks through GenAI-driven simulation and feedback, combining physical-layer protection, secure learning pipelines, and cognitive-layer resilience.

Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\\mathcal{H}=\\mathcal{H}_F\\otimes \\mathcal{H}_D$, where $\\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\\mathcal{H}_D=\\mathcal{H}_{F'}\\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{\\widetilde{D}}$, where $\\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\\mathcal{H}_{\\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15959v4\n    "}}

In this paper, we study fully decentralized FL, where in addition to devices conducting training locally, they carry out model aggregations via cooperative consensus formation over device-to-device (D2D) networks. We introduce asynchronous, event-triggered communications among the devices to handle settings where access to a central server is not feasible. To account for the inherent resource heterogeneity and statistical diversity challenges in FL, we define personalized communication triggering conditions at each device that weigh the change in local model parameters against the available local network resources. We theoretically recover the $O(\\ln{k} / \\sqrt{k})$ convergence rate to the globally optimal model of decentralized gradient descent (DGD) methods in the setup of our methodology. We provide our convergence guarantees for the last iterates of models, under relaxed graph connectivity and data heterogeneity assumptions compared with the existing literature. To do so, we demonstrate a $B$-connected information flow guarantee in the presence of sporadic communications over the time-varying D2D graph. Our subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in convergence speed and/or communication savings compared to existing decentralized FL baselines.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12640v2\n    "}}

In response, numerous IPI-centric defense frameworks have emerged. However, these defenses are fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present the first comprehensive analysis of IPI-centric defense frameworks. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of these defenses, classifying them along five dimensions. We then thoroughly assess the security and usability of representative defense frameworks. Through analysis of defensive failures in the assessment, we identify six root causes of defense circumvention. Based on these findings, we design three novel adaptive attacks that significantly improve attack success rates targeting specific frameworks, demonstrating the severity of the flaws in these defenses. Our paper provides a foundation and critical insights for the future development of more secure and usable IPI-centric agent defense frameworks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15203v1\n    "}}

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promise, yet classical models rely on large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are parameter-heavy and memory-bound. We propose a Quantum Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) within a DRL framework, where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) replace conventional MLPs at critical readout stages. The hybrid model maintains the expressive capacity of graph attention encoders while reducing trainable parameters by more than 50%. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO) with greedy and stochastic decoding, experiments on VRP benchmarks show that Q-GAT achieves faster convergence and reduces routing cost by about 5% compared with classical GAT baselines. These results demonstrate the potential of PQC-enhanced GNNs as compact and effective solvers for large-scale routing and logistics optimization.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15175v1\n    "}}

Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLM) offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for efficient light manipulation beyond conventional single-material metasurfaces, enabling dual-resonance cavities that can simultaneously enhance pump excitation and SPE collection. However, traditional trial-and-error and forward optimization methods face significant challenges in designing these complex structures due to the vast parameter space and computational demands. Here, we present NanoPhotoNet-Inverse, an artificial intelligence-driven inverse design framework based on a hybrid deep neural network architecture. This model efficiently performs inverse design of two dual-resonance MLM cavities to amplify pump and SPE emissions of different vacancies in nanodiamond and improve SPE collection. Our approach achieves inverse design prediction efficiency exceeding 98.7%, demonstrating three orders of magnitude amplification in SPE count rate and 50 picosecond lifetime, significantly surpassing conventional cavity designs. These remarkable enhancements in emission rates and collection efficiency position our platform as a transformative technology for advancing quantum communication networks, quantum computing architectures, quantum sensing applications, and quantum cryptography systems. Therefore, it opens new pathways for intelligent photonic device engineering in quantum technologies.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15170v1\n    "}}

Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15144v1\n    "}}

To meet diverse demands from varying-length requests in online services, existing state-of-the-art systems tune the sequence parallelism (SP) allocation. However, current dynamic SP allocation lacks flexibility to (1) support stage-specific parallelism requirements in LLM inference, (2) mitigate the global latency degradation from excessive SP allocation, and (3) exploit resource fragments arising from SP size variation.\n  To tackle this problem, we propose Chunkwise Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (CDSP), a fine-grained parallelism strategy that assigns SP sizes across \\textit{intra-request} token segments. Based on CDSP, we build Tetris, an LLM serving system that (1) efficiently integrates CDSP into disaggregated cluster to satisfy parallelism heterogeneity, (2) dynamically regulates SP size expansion based on real-time load conditions, and (3) adaptively explores chunking plans to utilize fragmented resources while meeting per-request demands. Compared with state-of-the-art systems, Tetris achieves up to 4.35$\\times$ lower time-to-first-token (TTFT) under max sustainable loads, reduces median time-between-tokens (TBT) by up to 40.1\\%, and increases the max request capacity by up to 45\\%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06247v2\n    "}}

However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states.

As a first step toward this vision, we present Petridish, a system built on top of confidential computing and its core contribution, a novel technology called Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD). Petridish runs the LLM service inside a confidential virtual machine (CVM), which protects the secrets, i.e., the LLM parameters and user prompts, from adversaries outside the CVM. Importantly, it splits the LLM service for a user into two processes, using SPD: a per-user process performs prefill with the user prompts and computes attention scores during decoding; a service process, shared by all users, batches the attention scores from per-user processes and generates output tokens for all users. Both the LLM provider and the users trust Petridish's CVM and its operating system, which guarantees isolation between processes and limits their outbound network capabilities to control information flow. The CVM's attestation capability and its open-source software stack enable Petridish to provide auditable protection of both user prompt and LLM confidentiality. Together, Petridish maintains full utility of LLM service and enables practical, privacy-preserving cloud-hosted LLM inference for sensitive applications, such as processing personal data, clinical records, and financial documents.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19134v5\n    "}}

However, as system prompts become valuable intellectual property, they are increasingly vulnerable to prompt theft and unauthorized use, highlighting the urgent need for effective copyright auditing, especially watermarking. Existing methods rely on verifying subtle logit distribution shifts triggered by a query. We observe that this logit-dependent verification framework is impractical in real-world content-only settings, primarily because (1) random sampling makes content-level generation unstable for verification, and (2) stronger instructions needed for content-level signals compromise prompt fidelity.\n  To overcome these challenges, we propose PromptCOS, the first content-only system prompt copyright auditing method based on content-level output similarity. PromptCOS achieves watermark stability by designing a cyclic output signal as the conditional instruction's target. It preserves prompt fidelity by injecting a small set of auxiliary tokens to encode the watermark, leaving the main prompt untouched. Furthermore, to ensure robustness against malicious removal, we optimize cover tokens, i.e., critical tokens in the original prompt, to ensure that removing auxiliary tokens causes severe performance degradation. Experimental results show that PromptCOS achieves high effectiveness (99.3% average watermark similarity), strong distinctiveness (60.8% higher than the best baseline), high fidelity (accuracy degradation no greater than 0.6%), robustness (resilience against four potential attack categories), and high computational efficiency (up to 98.1% cost saving).

For finite-time processes, part of the extractable work is inevitably dissipated, motivating the search for driving protocols that minimize the work. While classical stochastic systems have been extensively explored, quantum analyses remain limited and often rely on Markovian master equations valid only in the weak-coupling regime. Here, we study minimal work protocols for representative two-level systems coupled to a harmonic-oscillator bath using a numerically exact method. Inspired by known optimal solutions for Brownian oscillators, we introduce an impulse ansatz that incorporates possible boundary impulses and test it across a wide range of bath parameters. We find that impulse-like features remain nearly optimal in the quantum, non-Markovian regime, at short times. We also identify cases in which the widely used Markovian master equation fails even at weak coupling, underscoring the need for fully quantum approaches to finite-time thermodynamic optimization.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15084v1\n    "}}

This work presents the first practical zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols for PSPACE-complete statements by enabling ZK proofs of QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) evaluation. The core idea is to validate quantified resolution proofs (Q-Res) in ZK. We develop an efficient polynomial encoding of Q-Res proofs, enabling proof validation through low-overhead arithmetic checks. We also design a ZK protocol to prove knowledge of a winning strategy related to the QBF, which is often equally important in practice. We implement our protocols and evaluate them on QBFEVAL. The results show that our protocols can verify 72% of QBF evaluations via Q-Res proof and 82% of instances' winning strategies within 100 seconds, for instances where such proofs or strategies can be obtained.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15071v1\n    "}}

This paper presents the first systematic study of the single-message shuffle model from an information-theoretic perspective. We analyze two regimes: the shuffle-only setting, where each user directly submits its message ($Y_i=X_i$), and the shuffle-DP setting, where each user first applies a local $\\varepsilon_0$-differentially private mechanism before shuffling ($Y_i=\\mathcal{R}(X_i)$). Let $\\boldsymbol{Z} = (Y_{\u03c3(i)})_i$ denote the shuffled sequence produced by a uniformly random permutation $\u03c3$, and let $K = \u03c3^{-1}(1)$ represent the position of user 1's message after shuffling.\n  For the shuffle-only setting, we focus on a tractable yet expressive \\emph{basic configuration}, where the target user's message follows $Y_1 \\sim P$ and the remaining users' messages are i.i.d.\\ samples from $Q$, i.e., $Y_2,\\dots,Y_n \\sim Q$. We derive asymptotic expressions for the mutual information quantities $I(Y_1;\\boldsymbol{Z})$ and $I(K;\\boldsymbol{Z})$ as $n \\to \\infty$, and demonstrate how this analytical framework naturally extends to settings with heterogeneous user distributions.\n  For the shuffle-DP setting, we establish information-theoretic upper bounds on total information leakage. When each user applies an $\\varepsilon_0$-DP mechanism, the overall leakage satisfies $I(K; \\boldsymbol{Z}) \\le 2\\varepsilon_0$ and $I(X_1; \\boldsymbol{Z}\\mid (X_i)_{i=2}^n) \\le (e^{\\varepsilon_0}-1)/(2n) + O(n^{-3/2})$. These results bridge shuffle differential privacy and mutual-information-based privacy.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15051v1\n    "}}

Close to phase transitions, they respond collectively to external perturbations, which can be harnessed for technological applications in the domain of quantum metrology and sensing. Owing to the controllable complexity and straightforward interpretability of Rydberg atoms, we can observe and tune the emergent collective nonlinearity. Here, we investigate the application of an interacting Rydberg vapour for the purpose of time series prediction. The vapour is driven by a laser field whose Rabi frequency is modulated in order to input the time series. We find that close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where collective effects are amplified, the capability of the system to learn the input becomes enhanced. This is reflected in an increase of the accuracy with which future values of the time series can be predicted. Using the Lorenz time series and temperature data as examples, our work demonstrates how emergent phenomena enhance the capability of noisy many-body quantum systems for data processing and forecasting.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15047v1\n    "}}

While URLs are an important part of phishing campaigns, communicative elements like text and images are central in triggering the required user behavior. Further, due to advances in phishing detection, attackers react by scaling campaigns to larger numbers and diversifying and personalizing content. In addition to established mechanisms, such as template-based generation, large language models (LLMs) can be used for phishing content generation, enabling attacks to scale in minutes, challenging existing phishing detection paradigms through personalized content, stealthy explicit phishing keywords, and dynamic adaptation to diverse attack scenarios. Countering these dynamically changing attack campaigns requires a comprehensive understanding of the complex LLM-related threat landscape. Existing studies are fragmented and focus on specific areas. In this work, we provide the first holistic examination of LLM-generated phishing content. First, to trace the exploitation pathways of LLMs for phishing content generation, we adopt a modular taxonomy documenting nine stages by which adversaries breach LLM safety guardrails. We then characterize how LLM-generated phishing manifests as threats, revealing that it evades detectors while emphasizing human cognitive manipulation. Third, by taxonomizing defense techniques aligned with generation methods, we expose a critical asymmetry that offensive mechanisms adapt dynamically to attack scenarios, whereas defensive strategies remain static and reactive. Finally, based on a thorough analysis of the existing literature, we highlight insights and gaps and suggest a roadmap for understanding and countering LLM-driven phishing at scale.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21457v2\n    "}}

While major security scanners focus on identifying known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in open-source packages, there are very few studies on detecting malicious packages. Malicious open-source package detection typically requires static, dynamic analysis, or both. Dynamic analysis is more effective as it can expose a package's behaviors at runtime. However, current dynamic analysis tools (e.g., ossf's package-analysis) lack an automatic method to differentiate malicious packages from benign packages. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract the features from dynamic analysis (e.g., executed commands) and leverage machine learning techniques to automatically classify packages as benign or malicious. Our evaluation of nearly 2000 packages on npm shows that the machine learning classifier achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a false positive rate of nearly 0%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15033v1\n    "}}

Their scale and distribution make them especially vulnerable to faults and attacks. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerant methods either consume excessive resources or provide only eventual guarantees, making them unsuitable for real-time resource-constrained CPS.\n  We present GeoShield, a resource-efficient solution for defending geo-distributed CPS against Byzantine faults. GeoShield leverages the property that CPS are designed to tolerate brief disruptions and maintain safety, as long as they recover (i.e., resume normal operations or transition to a safe mode) within a bounded amount of time following a fault. Instead of masking faults, it detects them and recovers the system within bounded time, thus guaranteeing safety with much fewer resources. GeoShield introduces protocols for Byzantine fault-resilient network measurement and inter-region omission fault detection that proactively detect malicious message delays, along with recovery mechanisms that guarantee timely recovery while maximizing operational robustness.

These embedding vector databases serve as the long-term memory of LLMs, enabling efficient handling of a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, the surge in popularity of embedding vector databases in LLMs has been accompanied by significant concerns about privacy leakage. Embedding vector databases are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion attacks, where adversaries can exploit the embeddings to reverse-engineer and extract sensitive information from the original text data. Existing defense mechanisms have shown limitations, often struggling to balance security with the performance of downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Eguard, a novel defense mechanism designed to mitigate embedding inversion attacks. Eguard employs a transformer-based projection network and text mutual information optimization to safeguard embeddings while preserving the utility of LLMs. Our approach significantly reduces privacy risks, protecting over 95% of tokens from inversion while maintaining high performance across downstream tasks consistent with original embeddings.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05034v2\n    "}}

This abstraction extends the OptiGraph model in Plasmo$.$jl, where optimization problems are represented as hypergraphs with nodes that define modular subproblems (variables, constraints, and objectives) and edges that encode algebraic linking constraints between nodes. The RemoteOptiGraph allows OptiGraphs to be utilized in distributed memory environments through InterWorkerEdges, which manage linking constraints that span workers. This abstraction offers a unified approach for modeling optimization problems on distributed memory systems (avoiding bespoke modeling approaches), and provides a basis for developing general-purpose meta-algorithms that can exploit distributed memory structure such as Benders or Lagrangian decompositions. We implement this abstraction in the open-source package, Plasmo$.$jl and we illustrate how it can be used by solving a mixed integer capacity expansion model for the western United States containing over 12 million variables and constraints. The RemoteOptiGraph abstraction together with Benders decomposition performs 7.5 times faster than solving the same problem without decomposition.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14966v1\n    "}}

Retraining is limited by the cost and time of manual labeling or sandbox analysis. Existing approaches mitigate this via drift detection and selective labeling, but fully label-free adaptation remains largely unexplored. Recent self-training methods use a previously trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and then train a new model on these labels. The unlabeled data are used only for inference and do not participate in training the earlier model. We argue that these unlabeled samples still carry valuable information that can be leveraged when incorporated appropriately into training. This paper introduces LFreeDA, an end-to-end framework that adapts malware classifiers to drift without manual labeling or drift detection. LFreeDA first performs unsupervised domain adaptation on malware images, jointly training on labeled and unlabeled samples to infer pseudo-labels and prune noisy ones. It then adapts a classifier on CFG representations using the labeled and selected pseudo-labeled data, leveraging the scalability of images for pseudo-labeling and the richer semantics of CFGs for final adaptation. Evaluations on the real-world MB-24+ dataset show that LFreeDA improves accuracy by up to 12.6% and F1 by 11.1% over no-adaptation lower bounds, and is only 4% and 3.4% below fully supervised upper bounds in accuracy and F1, respectively. It also matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods provided with ground truth labels for 300 target samples. Additional results on two controlled-drift benchmarks further confirm that LFreeDA maintains malware detection performance as malware evolves without human labeling.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14963v1\n    "}}

Blockchain has been proposed as an enabler for trustworthy coordination among UTM stakeholders. Yet, its real-time performance under aeronautical constraints remains insufficiently characterized. This paper presentes a quantitative benchmark comparing two regulation compliant distributed architectures: the federated InterUSS platform maintained by the Linux Foundation and a permissioned blockchain based on Hyperledger Fabric. Both systems were evaluated through Operational Intent Reference (OIR) registration work loads generated via Hyperledger Caliper, measuring throughput, latency, and transaction loss under loads up to 50 transactions per second. Results show that InterUSS sustained sub-second latency and stable performance up to 30 TPS. At the same time, Fabric exhibited exponential degradation with median latency exceeding 3 s and tail latencies above 15 s beyond that point. These findings demonstrate that blockchain-based architectures must be redesigned to meet aeronautical timing and scalability requirements, suggesting that hybrid models combining distributed ledgers for auditability with federated frameworks for real-time coordination are more suitable for future UTM deployments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02171v2\n    "}}

Although this approach improves throughput, static or heuristic shard allocation often leads to workload skew, congestion, and excessive cross-shard communication diminishing the scalability benefits of sharding. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), a dynamic and intelligent allocation framework that proactively assigns accounts and transactions to shards based on workload forecasts. PSAP integrates a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning (Safe-PPO) controller, jointly enabling multi-block-ahead prediction and adaptive shard reconfiguration. The protocol enforces deterministic inference across validators through a synchronized quantized runtime and a safety gate that limits stake concentration, migration gas, and utilization thresholds. By anticipating hotspot formation and executing bounded, atomic migrations, PSAP achieves stable load balance while preserving Byzantine safety. Experimental evaluation on heterogeneous datasets, including Ethereum, NEAR, and Hyperledger Fabric mapped via address-clustering heuristics, demonstrates up to 2x throughput improvement, 35\\% lower latency, and 20\\% reduced cross-shard overhead compared to existing dynamic sharding baselines. These results confirm that predictive, deterministic, and security-aware shard allocation is a promising direction for next-generation scalable blockchain systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19450v1\n    "}}

However, this memory introduces critical risks when sensitive information is revealed in inappropriate contexts. We present CIMemories, a benchmark for evaluating whether LLMs appropriately control information flow from memory based on task context. CIMemories uses synthetic user profiles with over 100 attributes per user, paired with diverse task contexts in which each attribute may be essential for some tasks but inappropriate for others. Our evaluation reveals that frontier models exhibit up to 69% attribute-level violations (leaking information inappropriately), with lower violation rates often coming at the cost of task utility. Violations accumulate across both tasks and runs: as usage increases from 1 to 40 tasks, GPT-5's violations rise from 0.1% to 9.6%, reaching 25.1% when the same prompt is executed 5 times, revealing arbitrary and unstable behavior in which models leak different attributes for identical prompts. Privacy-conscious prompting does not solve this - models overgeneralize, sharing everything or nothing rather than making nuanced, context-dependent decisions. These findings reveal fundamental limitations that require contextually aware reasoning capabilities, not just better prompting or scaling.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14937v1\n    "}}

In the case of quantum spin models with continuous symmetry, we show that this adiabatic process is also accompanied by the suppression of the fluctuations of the symmetry generator -- namely, the collective spin component along an axis of symmetry. In systems of $S=1/2$ spins or qubits, the combination of the suppression of fluctuations along one direction and of the persistence of transverse magnetization leads to spin squeezing -- a much sought-after property of quantum states, both for the purpose of entanglement detection as well as for metrological uses. Focusing on the case of XXZ models spontaneously breaking a U(1) (or even SU(2)) symmetry, we show that the adiabatically prepared states have nearly minimal spin uncertainty; that the minimum phase uncertainty that one can achieve with these states scales as $N^{-3/4}$ with the number of spins $N$; and that this scaling is attained after an adiabatic preparation time scaling linearly with $N$. Our findings open the door to the adiabatic preparation of strongly spin-squeezed states in a large variety of quantum many-body devices including e.g. optical lattice clocks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08607v2\n    "}}

One critical issue is Random Access (RA) signaling storms where, a burst of illegitimate or misbehaving user equipments (UEs) send Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection requests that rapidly saturate a Central Unit's (CU) processing pipeline. Such storms trigger widespread connection failures within the short contention resolution window defined by 3GPP. Existing detection and mitigation approaches based on near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (n-RT RIC) applications cannot guarantee a timely reaction to such attacks as RIC control loops incur tens to hundreds of milliseconds of latency due to the non-deterministic nature of their general purpose processor (GPP) based architectures. This paper presents RAID, an in-network RA signaling storm detection and mitigation system that leverages P4-programmable switch ASICs to enable real-time protection from malicious attacks. RAID embeds a lightweight Random Forest (RF) classifier into a programmable Tofino switch, enabling line-rate flow classification with deterministic microsecond-scale inference delay. By performing ML-based detection directly in the data plane, RAID catches and filters malicious RA requests before they reach and overwhelm the RRC. RAID achieves above 94% detection accuracy with a fixed per-flow inference delay on the order of 3.4 microseconds, effectively meeting strict O-RAN control-plane deadlines. These improvements are sustained across multiple traffic loads, making RAID a fast and scalable solution for the detection and mitigation of signaling storms in 5G O-RAN.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14921v1\n    "}}

Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.\n  To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.\n  We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14876v1\n    "}}

We relate the minimum time to the Quantum Fisher Information ($F_Q$) for a system of $N$ quantum spins on a $d$-dimensional lattice with $1/r^\u03b1$ interactions with $r$ being the distance between two interacting spins. We focus on states with $F_Q \\sim N^{1+\u03b3}$ where $\u03b3\\in (0,1]$, i.e., scaling from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. For short-range interactions ($\u03b1> 2d+1$), we prove the minimum time $t$ scales as $t \\gtrsim L^\u03b3$, where $L \\sim N^{1/d}$. For long-range interactions, we find a hierarchy of possible speedups: $t \\gtrsim L^{\u03b3(\u03b1-2d)}$ for $2d < \u03b1< 2d+1$, $t \\gtrsim \\log L$ for $(2-\u03b3)d < \u03b1< 2d$, and $t$ may even vanish algebraically in $1/L$ for $\u03b1< (2-\u03b3)d$. These bounds extend to the minimum circuit depth required for state preparation, assuming two-qubit gate speeds scale as $1/r^\u03b1$. We further show that these bounds are saturable, up to sub-polynomial corrections, for all $\u03b1$ at the Heisenberg limit ($\u03b3=1$) and for $\u03b1> (2-\u03b3)d$ when $\u03b3<1$.

However, practical adoption has been hindered by low GPU utilization of existing parallel implementations. To address this challenge, we present a GPU-accelerated operator library, named PolyKAN which is the first general open-source implementation of KAN and its variants. PolyKAN fuses the forward and backward passes of polynomial KAN layers into a concise set of optimized CUDA kernels. Four orthogonal techniques underpin the design: (i) \\emph{lookup-table} with linear interpolation that replaces runtime expensive math-library functions; (ii) \\emph{2D tiling} to expose thread-level parallelism with preserving memory locality; (iii) a \\emph{two-stage reduction} scheme converting scattered atomic updates into a single controllable merge step; and (iv) \\emph{coefficient-layout reordering} yielding unit-stride reads under the tiled schedule. Using a KAN variant, Chebyshev KAN, as a case-study, PolyKAN delivers $1.2$--$10\\times$ faster inference and $1.4$--$12\\times$ faster training than a Triton + cuBLAS baseline, with identical accuracy on speech, audio-enhancement, and tabular-regression workloads on both highend GPU and consumer-grade GPU.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14852v1\n    "}}

We develop a novel methodology called *Diodon* that addresses this challenge by splitting the codebase into the protocol implementation (the *Core*) and the remainder (the *Application*). This split allows us to apply powerful semi-automated verification techniques to the security-critical Core, while fully-automatic static analyses scale the verification to the entire codebase by ensuring that the Application cannot invalidate the security properties proved for the Core. The static analyses achieve that by proving *I/O independence*, i.e., that the I/O operations within the Application are independent of the Core's security-relevant data (such as keys), and that the Application meets the Core's requirements. We have proved Diodon sound by first showing that we can safely allow the Application to perform I/O independent of the security protocol, and second that manual verification and static analyses soundly compose. We evaluate Diodon on two case studies: an implementation of the signed Diffie-Hellman key exchange and a large (100k+ LoC) production Go codebase implementing a key exchange protocol for which we obtained secrecy and injective agreement guarantees by verifying a Core of about 1% of the code with the auto-active program verifier Gobra in less than three person months.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00595v2\n    "}}

By considering noise induced error in the initial system state preparation, we analyse the robustness of various models exhibiting the QME. We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state, making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast, we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation, we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a stronger QME.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14837v1\n    "}}

Existing VD techniques, whether traditional machine learning-based or LLM-based approaches like prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, or off-policy preference optimization, remain fundamentally limited in their ability to perform context-aware analysis: They depend on fixed inputs or static preference datasets, cannot adaptively explore repository-level dependencies, and are constrained by function-level benchmarks that overlook critical vulnerability context.\n  This paper introduces Vulnerability-Adaptive Policy Optimization (VULPO), an on-policy LLM reinforcement learning framework for context-aware VD. To support training and evaluation, we first construct ContextVul, a new dataset that augments high-quality function-level samples with lightweight method to extract repository-level context information. We then design multi-dimensional reward structuring that jointly captures prediction correctness, vulnerability localization accuracy, and the semantic relevance of vulnerability analysis, thereby guiding the model toward comprehensive contextual reasoning. To address the asymmetric difficulty of different vulnerability cases and mitigate reward hacking, VULPO incorporates label-level and sample-level difficulty-adaptive reward scaling, encouraging the model to explore challenging cases while maintaining balanced reward distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VULPO framework in context-aware VD: Our VULPO-4B substantially outperforms existing VD baselines based on prompt engineering and off-policy optimization, improving F1 by 85% over Qwen3-4B and achieving performance comparable to a 150x larger-scale model, DeepSeek-R1-0528.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11896v2\n    "}}

We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time comparable to the inverse of the energy gap in the physical spectrum.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14732v1\n    "}}

Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with 103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\\%, 72.8\\%, and 78.6\\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively. Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\\%, 16.5\\%, and 75.7\\% of subtasks and required 86.2\\%, 118.7\\%, and 205.9\\% more model queries. This suggests that incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07939v2\n    "}}

A large variety of different such AT metrics have been proposed, and despite their wide-spread practical use, no systematic treatment of attack tree metrics so far is fully satisfactory. Existing approaches either fail to include important metrics, or they are too general to provide a useful systematic way for defining concrete AT metrics, giving only an abstract characterisation of their behaviour. We solve this problem by developing a compositional theory of ATs and their functorial semantics based on gs-monoidal categories. Viewing attack trees as string diagrams, we show that components of ATs form a channel category, a particular type of gs-monoidal category. AT metrics then correspond to functors of channel categories. This characterisation is both general enough to include all common AT metrics, and concrete enough to define AT metrics by their logical structure.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14717v1\n    "}}

Federated learning addresses this issue by enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global deep learning model without compromising their data privacy. However, the performance of such a model degrades under label skew, where the label distribution differs between clients. To overcome this issue, a novel method called FedEntOpt is proposed. In each round, it selects clients to maximize the entropy of the aggregated label distribution, ensuring that the global model is exposed to data from all available classes. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 6% in classification accuracy under standard settings regardless of the model size, while achieving gains of over 30% in scenarios with low participation rates and client dropout. In addition, FedEntOpt offers the flexibility to be combined with existing algorithms, enhancing their classification accuracy by more than 40%. Importantly, its performance remains unaffected even when differential privacy is applied.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01240v3\n    "}}

Nonetheless, simulation is critical to the success of the field and a requirement for algorithm development and validation, as well as hardware design. GPU-acceleration has become standard practice for simulation, and due to the exponential scaling inherent in classical methods, multi-GPU simulation can be required to achieve representative system sizes. In this case, inter-GPU communications can bottleneck performance. In this work, we present the introduction of MPI into the QED-C Application-Oriented Benchmarks to facilitate benchmarking on HPC systems. We review the advances in interconnect technology and the APIs for multi-GPU communication. We benchmark using a variety of interconnect paths, including the recent NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 architecture that represents the first product to expand high-bandwidth GPU-specialized interconnects across multiple nodes. We show that while improvements to GPU architecture have led to speedups of over 4.5X across the last few generations of GPUs, advances in interconnect performance have had a larger impact with over 16X performance improvements in time to solution for multi-GPU simulations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14664v1\n    "}}

The applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements. This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end latency or TPOT related SLOs.\n  This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to 35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the other two solutions.

In this work, we numerically calculate the Hamiltonian limit of a U$(1)$ gauge theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions. This is achieved by Monte Carlo simulations in the Lagrangian formalism with lattices that are anisotropic in the time direction. For each ensemble, we determine the ratio between the temporal and spatial scale with the static quark potential and extrapolate to $a_t \\to 0$. Our results are compared with the data from Hamiltonian simulations at small volumes, showing agreement within $<2\u03c3$. These results can be used to match the two formalisms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11480v2\n    "}}

In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00116v2\n    "}}

Based on recent advancements in reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT), a variant of DFT that is believed to be better suited for strongly correlated systems, we construct a mathematical framework generalizing all ground state functional theories, which in particular applies to fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems. We show that within the special class of such functional theories where the space of external potentials forms the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group, the $N$-representability problem is readily solved by applying techniques from the study of momentum maps in symplectic geometry, an approach complementary to Klyachko's famous solution to the quantum marginal problem. The ``boundary force'', a diverging repulsive force from the boundary of the functional's domain observed in previous works but only qualitatively understood in isolated systems, is studied quantitatively and extensively in our work. Specifically, we present a formula capturing the exact behavior of the functional close to the boundary. In the case where the Lie algebra is abelian, a completely rigorous proof of the boundary force formula based on Levy-Lieb constrained search is given. Our formula is a first step towards developing more accurate functional approximations, with the potential of improving current RDMFT approximate functionals such as the Piris natural orbital functionals (NOFs).

Despite their growing importance, the security of MLTSF models against backdoor attacks remains entirely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose BadTime, the first effective backdoor attack tailored for MLTSF. BadTime can manipulate hundreds of future predictions toward a target pattern by injecting a subtle trigger. BadTime addresses two key challenges that arise uniquely in MLTSF: (i) the rapid dilution of local triggers over long horizons, and (ii) the extreme sparsity of backdoor signals under stealth constraints. To counter dilution, BadTime leverages inter-variable correlations, temporal lags, and data-driven initialization to design a distributed, lag-aware trigger that ensures effective influence over long-range forecasts. To overcome sparsity, it introduces a hybrid strategy to select valuable poisoned samples and a decoupled backdoor training objective that adaptively adjusts the model's focus on the sparse backdoor signal, ensuring reliable learning at a poisoning rate as low as 1%. Extensive experiments show that BadTime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on time series forecasting by extending the attackable horizon from at most 12 timesteps to 720 timesteps (a 60-fold improvement), reducing MAE by over 50% on target variables, and boosting stealthiness by more than 3-fold under anomaly detection.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04189v2\n    "}}

While surface codes are well understood in terms of their logical operators and boundary behavior, much less is known about tile codes. In this work, we establish a natural and precise description of their logical operator space. We prove that, under mild assumptions, any tile code admits a canonical symplectic basis of logical operators supported along lattice boundaries, which can be generated efficiently by a simple cellular automaton with the number of update rules only depending on the non-locality of the tile code. Further, we develop algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks for tile codes, by resolving them by translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer models and showing that they arise as derived sections of a Koszul complex on $\\mathbb{P}^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}^1$. Finally, we introduce the concept of derived automorphisms for quantum codes. These are automorphism-like operations that can exist even for codes that do not have symmetries. We explain how derived automorphisms can be implemented for tile codes in a low-overhead and fault-tolerant manner by extending the lattice on one side and shrinking it on the other. While this operation is trivial for the surface code, it induces a product of logical CNOT gates on the encoded information. Our results provide new structural insights into tile codes and lay the groundwork for tile codes as building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14589v1\n    "}}

Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus.

A striking example is the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), in which a system can exhibit anomalous relaxation, thermalizing faster from a state initially farther from equilibrium than from one closer. Here, we experimentally investigate the genuine QME and observe how the dynamics of a spin-1/2 system interacting with a heat sink can be sped-up to equilibrium. Furthermore, we apply the QME in a quantum Otto refrigerator, thereby increasing its cooling power.

Although the combination of multiple paths is beneficial in case of links with similar network characteristics, MPTCP performance is challenged as heterogeneity among the used paths increases. This work provides an overview of the MPTCP protocol operation, analyzes the state-of-art packet scheduling and congestion control algorithms available in literature, and examines the impact of the various algorithm combinations on MPTCP performance, by conducting an extensive experimental evaluation under diverse path-heterogeneity conditions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14550v1\n    "}}

Following the U.S. Department of the Treasury's sanctions against Tornado Cash in August 2022, platform activity declined sharply. We document a significant and sustained reduction in transaction volume, user diversity, and overall protocol utilization after the sanctions were imposed. Our analysis draws on transaction data from three major blockchains: Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon. We further examine developments following the partial lifting and eventual removal of sanctions by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in March 2025. Although activity partially recovered, the rebound remained limited. The Tornado Cash case illustrates how regulatory interventions can affect decentralized protocols, while also highlighting the challenges of fully enforcing such measures in decentralized environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09443v3\n    "}}

In practice, however, its anonymity can be undermined by user behaviour and operational quirks. We conduct the first cross-chain empirical study of Tornado Cash activity on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon, introducing three clustering heuristics-(i) address-reuse, (ii) transactional-linkage, and (iii) a novel first-in-first-out (FIFO) temporal-matching rule. Together, these heuristics reconnect deposits to withdrawals and deanonymise a substantial share of recipients. Our analysis shows that 5.1 - 12.6% of withdrawals can already be traced to their originating deposits through address reuse and transactional linkage heuristics. Adding our novel First-In-First-Out (FIFO) temporal-matching heuristic lifts the linkage rate by a further 15 - 22 percentage points. Statistical tests confirm that these FIFO matches are highly unlikely to occur by chance. Comparable leakage across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon indicates chain-agnostic user misbehaviour, rather than chain-specific protocol flaws. These results expose how quickly cryptographic guarantees can unravel in everyday use, underscoring the need for both disciplined user behaviour and privacy-aware protocol design. In total, our heuristics link over $2.3 billion in Tornado Cash withdrawals to identifiable deposits, exposing significant cracks in practical anonymity.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09433v3\n    "}}

However, SI remains vulnerable to Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs), where adversaries exploit exposed smashed data to recover private inputs. Despite substantial progress in attack-defense methodologies, the fundamental quantification of privacy risks is still underdeveloped. This paper establishes an information-theoretic framework for privacy leakage in SI, defining leakage as the adversary's certainty and deriving both average-case and worst-case error lower bounds. We further introduce Fisher-approximated Shannon information (FSInfo), a new privacy metric based on Fisher Information (FI) that enables operational and tractable computation of privacy leakage. Building on this metric, we develop FSInfoGuard, a defense mechanism that achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff. Our empirical study shows that FSInfo is an effective privacy metric across datasets, models, and defense strengths, providing accurate privacy estimates that support the design of defense methods outperforming existing approaches in both privacy protection and utility preservation.

Fix a prime $\\ell \\geq 5$, a finite group $G$ with $\\#G = \\ell^n$, and an elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $Sel_\\ell(E/\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ and surjective mod-$\\ell$ Galois representation. We show that there exist infinitely many Galois extensions $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $Gal(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\simeq G$ for which the $\\ell$-Selmer group $Sel_\\ell(E/F)$ also vanishes. We obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the number $M(G, E; X)$ of such fields $F$ with absolute discriminant $|\u0394_F|\\leq X$, proving that there is an explicit constant $\u03b4>0$ such that $M(G, E; X) \\gg X^{\\frac{1}{\\ell^{n-1}(\\ell - 1)}} (\\log X)^{\u03b4- 1}$. The asymptotic for $M(G, E; X)$ matches the conjectural count for all $G$-extensions $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ for which $|\u0394_F|\\leq X$, up to a power of $\\log X$. This demonstrates that Selmer stability is not a rare phenomenon.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15945v2\n    "}}

Traditional detection relies on manual inspection with limited scalability. Machine/Deep Learning (M/DL) approaches automate detection but suffer from suboptimal precision, limited generalizability, and high retraining costs. This is because existing methods focus on topological structures rather than comprehensive semantic characteristics of Autonomous Systems (ASes), often misinterpreting functionally similar but topologically distant ASes.\n  To address this, we propose BGPShield, an anomaly detection framework built on LLM embeddings that captures the Behavior Portrait and Routing Policy Rationale of each AS beyond topology, such as operational scale and global role. We propose a segment-wise aggregation scheme to transform AS descriptions into LLM representations without information loss, and a lightweight contrastive reduction network to compress them into a semantic-consistent version. Using these representations, our AR-DTW algorithm aligns and accumulates semantic distances to reveal behavioral inconsistencies. Evaluated on 16 real-world datasets, BGPShield detects 100% of verified anomalies with a false discovery rate below 5%. Notably, the employed LLMs were released prior to evaluation events, verifying generalizability. Furthermore, BGPShield constructs representations for unseen ASes within one second, significantly outperforming BEAM which demands costly retraining (averaging 65 hours).\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14467v1\n    "}}

However, since the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market is negligible compared to the consumer electronics market, the so-called IIoT enhancements have not yet been implemented in silicon. Moreover, there is no guarantee that this situation will change soon. Thus, alternative solutions must be explored. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a scheme that uses a protocol capable of leveraging existing infrastructure to synchronize User Equipments (UEs), with one of the UEs serving as the master. If this master is connected via a wired link to the factory network, it can also function as a boundary clock for the factory network, including any Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) network. Furthermore, the 5G Core Network (5GC) and 5G Base Station (gNB) can also be synchronized if they are connected either to the factory network or to the master UE. The proposed solution is implemented and evaluated on a hardware testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI) and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Time offset and clock skew are analyzed using a moving average filter with various window sizes. Results show that a filter size of 1024 provides the best accuracy for offset prediction between UEs. In a controlled lab environment, the approach consistently achieves synchronization within +/-50 ns, leaving sufficient margin for synchronization errors in real deployments while still maintaining sub-microsecond accuracy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and high performance of the proposed protocol for stringent industrial use cases.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14462v1\n    "}}

Traditional wireline clock synchronization protocols, however, cannot achieve the performance in wireless environments without significant modifications. To address this challenge, we make use of the Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization protocol, which leverages the broadcast nature of wireless communications and remains both non-invasive and standard-compliant. We implement and validate this protocol on a low-cost testbed using ESP32 modules and a commercial Wi-Fi access point. To support further research and development, we release our implementation as open-source software under the GNU General Public License Version 3 license via the OpenWifiSync project on GitHub.\n  Our results demonstrate that synchronization accuracies within +/-30 microseconds are achievable using energy-efficient and affordable hardware, making this approach suitable for a wide range of use cases.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14457v1\n    "}}

While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL.\n  Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model. Our results offer insights for researchers and software architects aiming to build robust FL systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14456v1\n    "}}

Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels.\n  To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate Sigil's fidelity, robustness, and stealthiness.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14422v1\n    "}}

Solving such problems is computationally demanding because it requires repeatedly solving a PDE and using its solution within an optimization process. In this paper, we first propose a fully coherent quantum algorithm for solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed method combines a quantum PDE solver that prepares the solution vector as a quantum state, and a quantum optimizer that assumes oracle access to a quantized objective function. The central idea is the explicit construction of the oracle in a form of block-encoding for the objective function, which coherently uses the output of a quantum PDE solver. This enables us to avoid classical access to the full solution that requires quantum state tomography canceling out the potential quantum speedups. We also derive the overall computational complexity of the proposed method with respect to parameters for optimization and PDE simulation, where quantum speedup is inherited from the underlying quantum PDE solver. We numerically demonstrate the validity of the proposed method by applications, including a parameter calibration problem in the Black-Scholes equation and a material parameter design problem in the wave equation. This work presents the concept of composing quantum subroutines so that the weakness of one (i.e., prohibitive readout overhead) is neutralized by the strength of another (i.e., coherent oracle access), toward a bottleneck-free quantum algorithm.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14420v1\n    "}}

However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14406v1\n    "}}
