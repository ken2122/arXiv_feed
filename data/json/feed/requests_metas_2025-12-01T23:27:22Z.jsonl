However, the ubiquity of these libraries has made them prime targets for high-impact security vulnerabilities, as illustrated by incidents like Log4Shell. Despite their widespread adoption, Apache projects are not immune to recurring and severe security weaknesses. We conduct a historical analysis of the Apache ecosystem to follow the \"breadcrumb trail of vulnerabilities\" by compiling a comprehensive dataset of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). We examine trends in exploit recurrence, disclosure timelines, and remediation practices. Our analysis is guided by four key research questions: (1) What are the most persistent and repeated CWEs in Apache libraries? (2) How long do CVEs persist before being addressed? (3) What is the delay between CVE introduction and official disclosure? and (4) How long after disclosure are CVEs remediated? We present a detailed timeline of vulnerability lifecycle stages across Apache libraries and offer insights to improve secure coding practices, vulnerability monitoring, and remediation strategies. Our contributions include a curated dataset covering 24,285 Apache libraries, 1,285 CVEs, and 157 CWEs, along with empirical findings and developer-focused recommendations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02259v1\n    "}}

While GC^0 can compute functions requiring exponential-size circuits, Kumar (CCC 2023) showed that switching-lemma lower bounds for AC^0 extend to GC^0 with no loss in parameters.\n  We prove a parallel result for the polynomial method: any lower bound for AC^0[p] obtained via the polynomial method extends to GC^0[p] without loss in parameters. As a consequence, we show that the majority function MAJ requires depth-$d$ GC^0[p] circuits of size $2^{\u03a9(n^{1/2(d-1)})}$, matching the best-known lower bounds for AC^0[p]. This yields the most expressive class of non-monotone circuits for which exponential-size lower bounds are known for an explicit function. We also prove a similar result for the algorithmic method, showing that E^NP requires exponential-size GCC^0 circuits, extending a result of Williams (JACM 2014).\n  Finally, leveraging our improved classical lower bounds, we establish the strongest known unconditional separations between quantum and classical circuit classes. We separate QNC^0 from GC^0 and GC^0[p] in various settings and show that BQLOGTIME is not contained in GC^0. As a consequence, we construct an oracle relative to which BQP lies outside uniform GC^0, extending the Raz-Tal oracle separation between BQP and PH (STOC 2019).\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16406v3\n    "}}

Existing URL- and HTML-based detection systems struggle against obfuscation and visual deception. This paper presents \\textbf{PhishSnap}, a privacy-preserving, on-device phishing detection system leveraging perceptual hashing (pHash). Implemented as a browser extension, PhishSnap captures webpage screenshots, computes visual hashes, and compares them against legitimate templates to identify visually similar phishing attempts. A \\textbf{2024 dataset of 10,000 URLs} (70\\%/20\\%/10\\% train/validation/test) was collected from PhishTank and Netcraft. Due to security takedowns, a subset of phishing pages was unavailable, reducing dataset diversity. The system achieved \\textbf{0.79 accuracy}, \\textbf{0.76 precision}, and \\textbf{0.78 recall}, showing that visual similarity remains a viable anti-phishing measure. The entire inference process occurs locally, ensuring user privacy and minimal latency.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02243v1\n    "}}

We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\\%, 94\\%, and 49\\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14987v3\n    "}}

The resulting structure has a natural metric that allows for the study of differential operators and stochastic processes on the graph. Brownian motions in these domains have been extensively studied theoretically using their generators. However, less work has been done on practical algorithms for simulating these processes. We introduce the first algorithm for simulating Brownian motions on metric graphs through a timestep splitting Euler-Maruyama-based discretization of their corresponding stochastic differential equation. By applying this scheme to Langevin diffusions on metric graphs, we also obtain the first algorithm for sampling on metric graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of timestep splittings required for the algorithm to converge to the underlying stochastic process. We also show that the exit probabilities of the simulated particle converge to the vertex-edge jump probabilities of the underlying stochastic differential equation as the timestep goes to zero. Finally, since this method is highly parallelizable, we provide fast, memory-aware implementations of our algorithm in the form of custom CUDA kernels that are up to ~8000x faster than a GPU implementation using PyTorch on simple star metric graphs. Beyond simple star graphs, we benchmark our algorithm on a real cortical vascular network extracted from a DuMuX tissue-perfusion model for tracer transport. Our algorithm is able to run stable simulations with timesteps significantly larger than the stable limit of the finite volume method used in DuMuX while also achieving speedups of up to ~1500x.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02175v1\n    "}}

However, existing protocols that rely on weaker monitors to detect unsafe behavior often fail on complex tasks beyond the monitor's comprehension. We develop control protocols based on factored cognition, in which a trusted model decomposes a task, an untrusted model solves each resultant child task in isolation, and the results are reassembled into a full solution. These protocols may improve safety by several means, such as by simplifying the context for monitors, or by obscuring vulnerabilities in the environment. We implement our protocols in the APPS coding setting and red team them against backdoor attempts from an adversarial GPT-4.1 Nano. We find that: (i) Adding factored cognition to a trusted monitoring protocol can boost safety from 41% to 63%; (ii) Safety improves because monitor performance improves; (iii) Factored cognition makes it no harder for capable LLMs to write backdoors in APPS. While our protocols show low usefulness in APPS, they hold promise for more complex tasks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02157v1\n    "}}

Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly 20.8 hours.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05109v3\n    "}}
