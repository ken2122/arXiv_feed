By leveraging Software Defined Networking to control the links between virtualised network functions, SFCs provide a scalable approach to dealing with the increased pressures on network operation and management. However, embedding SFCs onto the underlying physical network and compute infrastructure is an NP-hard problem. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been used to address this issue, but they require significant time to evaluate solution quality (fitness) online, with most existing approaches instead adopting offline simulations or analytical evaluations.\n  To enable online use of GAs in solving the SFC embedding problem, we introduce a hybrid online-offline approach to efficiently evaluate the fitness of generated solutions. At the core of this is BENNS: a surrogate model that approximates fitness and is agnostic to topology, traffic, and SFC-embedding. We evaluate our approach in a static environment across five experiments, varying available resources and traffic loads, and in a dynamic network environment. Our results demonstrate that our approach is capable of exploring thousands of potential configurations and generating deployable solutions in 19.1 minutes on average, compared to online-only approaches, which take 17.8 hours on average to explore ten solutions in our experiments and do not converge on an optimal solution.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16856v2\n    "}}

We arrive at the following equally important, interesting new results:\n  We first extend the notions of the {\\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues, i.e., {\\em quantum pushdown system (qPDS)} and {\\em quantum Markov chains}, and prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a qPDS to be well formed, also presenting a method to extend the local transition function of a well-formed qPDS to a unitary local time evolution operator.\n  Next, we investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\\it generalized stateless quantum pushdown systems (gqBPA)} against {\\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\\it generalized stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\\it probabilistic computational tree logic}.\n  We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is in $\\mathit{NP}$-hard. Our reduction is from the {\\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $\\mathit{NP}$-complete problem.\n  Our above results advance the field of model-checking quantum systems significantly, since all of the above important and interesting results on model-checking quantum pushdown systems were completely unknown previously.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18439v10\n    "}}

To capture such behaviors, natural strategies are a recently proposed framework striking a balance between the ability of agents to strategize with memory and the model-checking complexity, but until now has been restricted to fully deterministic settings. For the first time, we consider the probabilistic temporal logics PATL and PATL* under natural strategies (NatPATL and NatPATL*, resp.). As main result we show that, in stochastic MAS, NatPATL model-checking is NP-complete when the active coalition is restricted to deterministic strategies. We also give a 2NEXPTIME complexity result for NatPATL* with the same restriction. In the unrestricted case, we give an EXPSPACE complexity for NatPATL and 3EXPSPACE complexity for NatPATL*.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12170v2\n    "}}

However, it is an open problem whether softmax attention Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are Turing-complete. In this paper, we prove a stronger result that length-generalizable softmax CoT transformers are Turing-complete. More precisely, our Turing-completeness proof goes via the CoT extension of the Counting RASP (C-RASP), which correspond to softmax CoT transformers that admit length generalization. We prove Turing-completeness for CoT C-RASP with causal masking over a unary alphabet (more generally, for letter-bounded languages). While we show this is not Turing-complete for arbitrary languages, we prove that its extension with relative positional encoding is Turing-complete for arbitrary languages. We empirically validate our theory by training transformers for languages requiring complex (non-linear) arithmetic reasoning.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20038v1\n    "}}

We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod n homology for all $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 2}$. As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod n homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected, area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated, and products of area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically area-minimizing. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045v5\n    "}}

RF-backscatter devices have emerged as a low-power solution for sensing, yet existing backscatter tags support a single sensor. Placing several single-sensor tags at one site increases attachment footprint and induces mutual coupling between nearby tag antennas, thereby limiting practical deployment.\n  We present MATRIX, a single-chain multi-sensor backscatter tag that concurrently supports multiple onboard sensors and multiplexes them as a composite voltage, then backscatters it through one analog modulation chain. Rather than time-division polling, which introduces inter-sensor sampling offsets, or frequency-division, which requires independent per-sensor modulation chains, MATRIX introduces a voltage-division multiplexing architecture in which each sensor value is encoded as a PWM waveform, carrying the measurement in its duty cycle and reserving the amplitude for multiplexing. To support reliable demultiplexing, MATRIX selects the voltage-division weights in a binary-weighted geometric progression so that every active-sensor set maps to a uniquely invertible, well-spaced composite voltage. The composite voltage is then converted into backscatter frequency shifts through a single modulation chain. At the receiver, MATRIX formulates demultiplexing as a Hidden Markov Model to recover per-sensor readings while tolerating analog hardware imperfections and multipath. MATRIX's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW. Detailed evaluation shows that the prototype, multiplexing five sensors, achieves 20 dB average signal reconstruction SNR at a 30 kHz sampling frequency; we further validate MATRIX with case studies in plant sensing, health monitoring, and microphone-based direction finding.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01360v2\n    "}}

Nevertheless, we prove that satisfiability is $\u03a3_1^1$-complete and thus not harder than for HyperLTL.

The branching-time properties of quantum CTMCs are specified by continuous stochastic logic (CSL), which is well-known for verifying real-time systems, including classical CTMCs. The core of checking the CSL formulas lies in tackling multiphase until formulas. We develop an algebraic method using proper projection, matrix exponentiation, and definite integration to symbolically calculate the probability measures of path formulas. Thus the decidability of CSL is established. To be efficient, numerical methods are incorporated to guarantee that the time complexity is polynomial in the encoding size of the input model and linear in the size of the input formula. A running example of Apollonian networks is further provided to demonstrate our method.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05412v6\n    "}}

In this paper, we present DecodeX, a unified benchmarking framework for evaluating low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding acceleration across different hardware platforms. DecodeX integrates a comprehensive suite of LDPC decoder implementations, including kernels, APIs, and test vectors for CPUs (FlexRAN), GPUs (Aerial and Sionna-RK), and ASIC (ACC100), and can be readily extended to additional architectures and configurations. Using DecodeX, we systematically characterize how different platforms orchestrate computation-from threading and memory management to data movement and accelerator offload-and quantify the resulting decoding latency under varying Physical layer parameters. Our observations reveal distinct trade-offs in parallel efficiency and offload overhead, showing that accelerator gains strongly depend on data-movement and workload granularity. Building on these insights, we discuss how cross-platform benchmarking can inform adaptive scheduling and co-design for future heterogeneous vRANs, enabling scalable and energy-efficient baseband processing for NextG wireless systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02952v1\n    "}}
