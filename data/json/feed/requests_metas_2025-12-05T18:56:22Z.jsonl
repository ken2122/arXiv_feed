However, these agents run within a complex multi-party ecosystem, where untrusted components can lead to data leakage, tampering, or unintended behavior. Existing Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) provide only per binary protection and offer no guarantees for cross-principal trust, accelerator-level isolation, or supervised agent behavior. We present Omega, a system that enables trusted AI agents by enforcing end-to-end isolation, establishing verifiable trust across all contributing principals, and supervising every external interaction with accountable provenance. Omega builds on Confidential VMs and Confidential GPUs to create a Trusted Agent Platform that hosts many agents within a single CVM using nested isolation. It also provides efficient multi-agent orchestration with cross-principal trust establishment via differential attestation, and a policy specification and enforcement framework that governs data access, tool usage, and inter-agent communication for data protection and regulatory compliance. Implemented on AMD SEV-SNP and NVIDIA H100, Omega fully secures agent state across CVM-GPU, and achieves high performance while enabling high-density, policy-compliant multi-agent deployments at cloud scale.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05951v1\n    "}}

Although narrowband techniques can probe specific resonances with high precision, a broadband spectroscopic approach captures the full spectrum of defect properties and dynamics. Two-level system (TLS) defects in amorphous dielectrics are a particularly important example because they are major sources of decoherence and energy loss in superconducting quantum devices. However, accessing and characterizing their collective dynamics remains far more challenging than probing individual TLS defects. Building on our previously developed Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) technique, we study the coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a wide frequency range of 3-5 GHz without requiring full device fabrication, revealing quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. The spectral response reveals distinct V-shaped structures corresponding to the bare eigenmode frequencies. Using these features, we extract a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz^-1 for a silicon sample, across a 4.1-4.6 GHz span. Furthermore, we systematically investigate amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes for multiple temperatures and inter-pulse delays, providing direct evidence of coherent dynamics and control. A driven minimal spin model with dipole-dipole interactions that qualitatively capture the observed behavior is presented. Our results establish BCTDS as a versatile platform for broadband defect spectroscopy, offering new capabilities for diagnosing and mitigating sources of decoherence, engineering many-body dynamics, and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena in disordered quantum systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05934v1\n    "}}

Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05851v1\n    "}}

While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs, 19X on GPUs, and 6X in distributed settings over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01678v3\n    "}}

We use a simpler lithography process where the entire device -- impedance transformer and JPA -- are patterned in a single electron beam lithography step, followed by a double-angle Dolan bridge technique for Al-AlO$_x$-Al deposition. We observe amplification with 18 dB gain over a wide $400\\,$MHz bandwidth centered around $5.3$GHz with added noise approaching the quantum limit, and a saturation power of $-114$dBm. To accurately explain our experimental results, we extend existing theories for impedance-engineered JPAs to incorporate the full sine nonlinearity of both the JPA and the transformer. Our work shows a path to simpler realization of broadband JPAs and provides a theoretical foundation for a regime of JPA operation that has been less explored in literature.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09298v2\n    "}}

Here, we extend the recent quantum algorithm for the incompressible LBM to account for realistic fluid dynamics setups by incorporating walls, inlets, outlets, and external forcing. We analyze the associated complexity cost and show that these modifications preserve the asymptotic scaling, and potential quantum advantage, of the original algorithm. Moreover, to support our theoretical analysis, we provide a classical numerical study illustrating the accuracy, complexity, and convergence of the algorithm for representative incompressible-flow cases, including the driven Taylor-Green vortex, the lid-driven cavity flow, and the flow past a cylinder. Our results provide a pathway to accurate quantum simulation of nonlinear fluid dynamics, and a framework for extending quantum LBM to more challenging flow configurations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05781v1\n    "}}

Existing defenses, designed primarily for text-only LLMs, are unsuitable for countering these multimodal threats, as they are easily bypassed, modality-dependent, or generalize poorly. Inspired by activation steering researches, we hypothesize that a robust, general defense independent of modality can be achieved by steering the model's behavior in the representation space. Through extensive experiments, we discover that the instruction-following behavior of MLLMs is encoded in a subspace. Steering along directions within this subspace can enforce adherence to user instructions, forming the basis of a defense. However, we also found that a naive defense direction could be coupled with a utility-degrading direction, and excessive intervention strength harms model performance. To address this, we propose ARGUS, which searches for an optimal defense direction within the safety subspace that decouples from the utility degradation direction, further combining adaptive strength steering to achieve a better safety-utility trade-off. ARGUS also introduces lightweight injection detection stage to activate the defense on-demand, and a post-filtering stage to verify defense success. Experimental results show that ARGUS can achieve robust defense against multimodal IPI while maximally preserving the MLLM's utility.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05745v1\n    "}}

First, we capture the complexity of preventing CSAM generation using a game-based security definition. Second, we show that current detection methods cannot remove all children from a dataset. Third, using an ethical proxy for CSAM (a child wearing glasses, hereafter, CWG), we show that even when only a small percentage of child images are left in the training dataset, there exist prompting strategies that generate CWG from a child-filtered T2I model using only a few more queries than when the model is trained on the unfiltered data. Fine-tuning the filtered model on child images further reduces the additional query overhead. We also show that reintroducing a concept is possible via fine-tuning even if filtering is perfect. Our results demonstrate that current filtering methods offer limited protection to closed-weight models and no protection to open-weight models, while reducing the generality of the model by hindering the generation of child-related concepts or changing their representation. We conclude by outlining challenges in conducting evaluations that establish robust evidence on the impact of AI safety mitigations for CSAM.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05707v1\n    "}}

However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05703v1\n    "}}

Existing backdoor attacks against VLMs primarily rely on explicit pixel-level triggers or imperceptible perturbations injected into images. While effective, these approaches reduce stealthiness and remain vulnerable to image-based defenses. We introduce concept-guided backdoor attacks, a new paradigm that operates at the semantic concept level rather than on raw pixels. We propose two different attacks. The first, Concept-Thresholding Poisoning (CTP), uses explicit concepts in natural images as triggers: only samples containing the target concept are poisoned, causing the model to behave normally in all other cases but consistently inject malicious outputs whenever the concept appears. The second, CBL-Guided Unseen Backdoor (CGUB), leverages a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) during training to intervene on internal concept activations, while discarding the CBM branch at inference time to keep the VLM unchanged. This design enables systematic replacement of a targeted label in generated text (for example, replacing \"cat\" with \"dog\"), even when the replacement behavior never appears in the training data. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures and datasets show that both CTP and CGUB achieve high attack success rates while maintaining moderate impact on clean-task performance. These findings highlight concept-level vulnerabilities as a critical new attack surface for VLMs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00713v2\n    "}}

Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05691v1\n    "}}

We identify a critical gap in this context: the absence of low-latency systems for high-quality and instantaneous monitoring of cellular transmissions. Such low-latency systems are crucial to allow for timely detection, decision, and disruption of unauthorized communication in sensitive areas. Operator-based monitoring systems, built for purposes such as people counting or tracking, lack real-time capability, require cooperation across multiple operators, and thus are hard to deploy. Operator-independent monitoring approaches proposed in the literature either lack low-latency capabilities or do not scale.\n  We propose WaveTag, the first low-latency and scalable system designed to monitor 5G and LTE connections across all operators prior to any user data transmission. WaveTag consists of several downlink sniffers and a distributed network of uplink sniffers that measure both downlink protocol information and uplink signal characteristics at multiple locations to gain a detailed spatial image of uplink signals. WaveTag then aggregates the recorded information, processes it, and provides a decision about the connection--all done prior to the complete connection establishment of a UE. To evaluate WaveTag, we deployed it in the context of geofencing, where WaveTag was able to determine whether the signals originate from inside or outside of an area within 2.3 ms of the initial base station-to-device message, therefore enabling prompt and targeted suppression of communication before any user data was transmitted. WaveTag achieved 99.66% geofencing classification accuracy. Finally, we conduct a real-world uplink measurement evaluation on a commercial 5G SA network.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25430v2\n    "}}

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16625v4\n    "}}

In QKD, one considers a setup in which two parties, Alice and Bob, share a key with one another in such a way that they can detect whether an eavesdropper, Eve, has learnt anything about the key. To our knowledge, in all QKD protocols proposed until now, Eve is detected by publicly comparing a subset of Alice and Bob's key and checking for errors. We find that a consequence of our protocol is that it is possible to detect eavesdroppers without publicly comparing any information about the key. Indeed, we prove that it is not possible for eavesdroppers, performing any individual attack, to extract useful information about the shared key without inducing a nonzero probability of being detected. We also prove the security of this protocol against a class of individual eavesdropping attacks. The role ICO plays in causing unusual phenomena in quantum technologies is an important question. By considering it we find a two-way QKD protocol that exhibits a similar private detection feature, albeit with some interesting differences. After noting some implications of these differences and discussing some of the practicalities of our protocol, we conclude that this work is best considered as a first step in applying quantum cryptographic ideas in an ICO.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03893v3\n    "}}

In this work, we present a new threat model that explores the feasibility of generating universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) when the attacker has access only to the edge portion of the model, consisting of its initial network layers. Unlike traditional attacks that require full model knowledge, our approach shows that adversaries can induce effective mispredictions in the unknown cloud component by manipulating key feature representations at the edge. Following the proposed threat model, we introduce both edge-only untargeted and targeted formulations of UAPs designed to control intermediate features before the split point. Our results on ImageNet demonstrate strong attack transferability to the unknown cloud part, and we compare the proposed method with classical white-box and black-box techniques, highlighting its effectiveness. Additionally, we analyze the capability of an attacker to achieve targeted adversarial effects with edge-only knowledge, revealing intriguing behaviors across multiple networks. By introducing the first adversarial attacks with edge-only knowledge in split inference, this work underscores the importance of addressing partial model access in adversarial robustness, encouraging further research in this area.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10500v2\n    "}}

Our algorithm is elegant and simple, and requires constant memory per particle. We prove that our algorithm always stabilises to a configuration with a unique leader, under a daemon satisfying some fairness guarantees (Gouda fairness [Gouda 2001]). We use the special geometric properties of programmable matter in 2D triangular grids to obtain the first self-stabilising algorithm for such systems. This result is surprising since it is known that silent self-stabilising algorithms for election in general distributed networks require $\u03a9(\\log{n})$ bits of memory per node, even for ring topologies [Dolev et al. 1999].\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08775v2\n    "}}

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v1\n    "}}

They also allow end-users to check that their computation has been performed as they have specified it.\n  However, existing protocols all have drawbacks that limit their usage in the real world. Most require the client to either operate a single-qubit source or perform single-qubit measurements, thus requiring them to still have some quantum technological capabilities albeit restricted, or require the server to perform operations which are hard to implement on real hardware (e.g isolate single photons from laser pulses and polarisation-preserving photon-number quantum non-demolition measurements). Others remove the need for quantum communications entirely but this comes at a cost in terms of security guarantees and memory overhead on the server's side.\n  We present an SDQC protocol which drastically reduces the technological requirements of both the client and the server while providing information-theoretic composable security. More precisely, the client only manipulates an attenuated laser pulse, while the server only handles interacting quantum emitters with a structure capable of generating spin-photon entanglement. The quantum emitter acts as both a converter from coherent laser pulses to polarisation-encoded qubits and an entanglement generator. Such devices have recently been used to demonstrate the largest entangled photonic state to date, thus hinting at the readiness of our protocol for experimental implementations.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12103v3\n    "}}

In response, recent work proposed a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) defense using data augmentation to achieve a \\enquote{deep} safety alignment, allowing the model to generate natural language refusals immediately following harmful prefills. Unfortunately, we show in this work that the \"deep\" safety alignment produced by such an approach is in fact not very deep. A generalization of the prefilling attack, which we refer to as the Rank-Assisted Prefilling (RAP) attack, can effectively extract harmful content from models fine-tuned with the data augmentation defense by selecting low-probability \"harmful\" tokens from the top 20 predicted next tokens at each step (thus ignoring high-probability \"refusal\" tokens). We argue that this vulnerability is enabled due to the \"gaming\" of the SFT objective when the target distribution entropies are low, where low fine-tuning loss is achieved by shifting large probability mass to a small number of refusal tokens while neglecting the high ranks of harmful tokens. We then propose a new perspective on achieving deep safety alignment by matching the token ranks of the target distribution, rather than their probabilities. This perspective yields a surprisingly simple fix to the data augmentation defense based on regularizing the attention placed on harmful prefill tokens, an approach we call PRefill attEntion STOpping (PRESTO). Adding PRESTO yields up to a 4.7x improvement in the mean StrongREJECT score under RAP attacks across three popular open-source LLMs, with low impact to model utility.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05518v1\n    "}}

Reduced-precision (below IEEE accuracy) is an established tool to address bandwidth constraints, although it remains unclear whether AoS and precision conversions should execute on a CPU or be deployed to a GPU if the compute kernel itself must run on an accelerator. On modern superchips where CPUs and GPUs share (logically) one data space, it is also unclear whether it is advantageous to stream data to the accelerator prior to the calculation, or whether we should let the accelerator transform data on demand, i.e.~work in-place logically. We therefore introduce compiler annotations to facilitate such conversions and to give the programmer the option to orchestrate the conversions in combination with GPU offloading. For some of our compute kernels of interest, Nvidia's G200 platforms yield a speedup of around 2.6 while AMD's MI300A exhibits more robust performance yet profits less. We assume that our compiler-based techniques are applicable to a wide variety of Lagrangian codes and beyond.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05516v1\n    "}}

But their random expert selection mechanism introduces significant data movement overhead that becomes the dominant bottleneck in multi-unit LLM serving systems.\n  To understand the patterns underlying this data movement, we conduct comprehensive data-movement-centric profiling across four state-of-the-art large-scale MoE models released in 2025 (200B-1000B) using over 24,000 requests spanning diverse workloads. We perform systematic analysis from both temporal and spatial perspectives and distill six key insights to guide the design of diverse future serving systems. With our insights, we then demonstrate how to improve wafer-scale GPUs as a case study, and show that minor architectural modifications leveraging the insights achieve substantial performance gains, delivering 5.3x and 3.1x average speedups on DeepSeek V3 and Qwen3, respectively.

Existing safety evaluation benchmarks and frameworks are often limited by an imbalanced integration of core components (attack, defense, and evaluation methods) and an isolation between flexible evaluation frameworks and standardized benchmarking capabilities. These limitations hinder reliable cross-study comparisons and create unnecessary overhead for comprehensive risk assessment. To address these gaps, we present TeleAI-Safety, a modular and reproducible framework coupled with a systematic benchmark for rigorous LLM safety evaluation. Our framework integrates a broad collection of 19 attack methods (including one self-developed method), 29 defense methods, and 19 evaluation methods (including one self-developed method). With a curated attack corpus of 342 samples spanning 12 distinct risk categories, the TeleAI-Safety benchmark conducts extensive evaluations across 14 target models. The results reveal systematic vulnerabilities and model-specific failure cases, highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and utility, and identifying potential defense patterns for future optimization. In practical scenarios, TeleAI-Safety can be flexibly adjusted with customized attack, defense, and evaluation combinations to meet specific demands. We release our complete code and evaluation results to facilitate reproducible research and establish unified safety baselines.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05485v1\n    "}}

However, fine-tuning these models on private datasets can raise privacy and proprietary concerns, such as the leakage of sensitive personal information. Differentially private (DP) code generation provides theoretical guarantees for protecting sensitive code by generating synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties while reducing privacy leakage concerns. However, DP code generation faces significant challenges due to the strict syntactic dependencies and the privacy-utility trade-off.\n  We propose PrivCode, the first DP synthesizer specifically designed for code datasets. It incorporates a two-stage framework to improve both privacy and utility. In the first stage, termed \"privacy-sanitizing\", PrivCode generates DP-compliant synthetic code by training models using DP-SGD while introducing syntactic information to preserve code structure. The second stage, termed \"utility-boosting\", fine-tunes a larger pre-trained LLM on the synthetic privacy-free code to mitigate the utility loss caused by DP, enhancing the utility of the generated code. Extensive experiments on four LLMs show that PrivCode generates higher-utility code across various testing tasks under four benchmarks. The experiments also confirm its ability to protect sensitive data under varying privacy budgets.

Most prior work on reducing model toxicity adopts reactive approaches, such as fine-tuning pre-trained (and potentially toxic) models to align them with human values. In contrast, we propose a proactive approach, IF-GUIDE, that leverages influence functions to identify and suppress harmful tokens in the training data. To this end, we first show that standard influence functions are ineffective at discovering harmful training records. We then present a novel adaptation that measures token-level attributions from training data to model toxicity, along with techniques for selecting toxic training documents and a learning objective that can be integrated into both pre-training and fine-tuning. Moreover, IF-GUIDE does not rely on human-preference data, which is typically required by existing alignment methods. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that IF-GUIDE substantially reduces both explicit and implicit toxicity-by up to 10$\\times$ compared to uncensored models, and up to 3$\\times$ compared to baseline alignment methods such as DPO and RAD-across both pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios. IF-GUIDE is computationally efficient: a billion-parameter model is not necessary for computing influence scores; a million-parameter model-with 7.5$\\times$ fewer parameters-can effectively serve as a proxy for identifying harmful data.

We introduce a new method where the verifier can request authentication only when needed, improving efficiency for quantum networks and blockchain applications. Our approach adapts the concept of zero-knowledge proofs widely used in classical cryptography to quantum settings, ensuring that verification reveals nothing about secret keys. We develop a general framework that converts any suitable quantum proof into a verifier-driven signature protocol and present a concrete implementation based on quantum measurements.

While machine learning-based PDF malware classifiers have shown promise, these classifiers are often susceptible to adversarial attacks, undermining their reliability. To address this issue, recent studies have aimed to enhance the robustness of PDF classifiers. Despite these efforts, the feature engineering underlying these studies remains outdated. Consequently, even with the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, these approaches fail to fundamentally resolve the issue of feature instability.\n  To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for PDF feature extraction and PDF malware detection. We introduce the PDFObj IR (PDF Object Intermediate Representation), an assembly-like language framework for PDF objects, from which we extract semantic features using a pretrained language model. Additionally, we construct an Object Reference Graph to capture structural features, drawing inspiration from program analysis. This dual approach enables us to analyze and detect PDF malware based on both semantic and structural features. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed classifier achieves strong adversarial robustness while maintaining an exceptionally low false positive rate of only 0.07% on baseline dataset compared to state-of-the-art PDF malware classifiers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17162v2\n    "}}

Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees.

However, due to the movement of devices, unfamiliar test samples constantly appear, significantly affecting the prediction accuracy of a pre-trained DNN. In addition, unstable network connection calls for local model inference. In this paper, we propose a light-weight scheme, called Anole, to cope with the local DNN model inference on mobile devices. The core idea of Anole is to first establish an army of compact DNN models, and then adaptively select the model fitting the current test sample best for online inference. The key is to automatically identify model-friendly scenes for training scene-specific DNN models. To this end, we design a weakly-supervised scene representation learning algorithm by combining both human heuristics and feature similarity in separating scenes. Moreover, we further train a model classifier to predict the best-fit scene-specific DNN model for each test sample. We implement Anole on different types of mobile devices and conduct extensive trace-driven and real-world experiments based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The results demonstrate that Anole outwits the method of using a versatile large DNN in terms of prediction accuracy (4.5% higher), response time (33.1% faster) and power consumption (45.1% lower).\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03331v2\n    "}}

This promise is stunted by significant risks - policy violations, process corruption, and security flaws - that stem from the lack of visibility and mechanisms to manage undesirable data flows produced by agent actions. Today, agent workflows are responsible for enforcing these policies in ad hoc ways. Just as data validation and access controls shifted from the application to the DBMS, freeing application developers from these concerns, we argue that systems should support Data Flow Controls (DFCs) and enforce DFC policies natively.

Their small sub-models learn quickly at first but become under-parameterized in later stages, leading to slow convergence and degraded generalization. We propose FedGMR - Federated Learning with Gradual Model Restoration under Asynchrony and Model Heterogeneity. FedGMR progressively increases each client's sub-model density during training, enabling BCCs to remain effective contributors throughout the process. In addition, we develop a mask-aware aggregation rule tailored for asynchronous MHFL and provide convergence guarantees showing that aggregated error scales with the average sub-model density across clients and rounds, while GMR provably shrinks this gap toward full-model FL. Extensive experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-100 demonstrate that FedGMR achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially under high heterogeneity and non-IID settings.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05372v1\n    "}}

This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21958v2\n    "}}

For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929v3\n    "}}

Overwriting Attacks Against Neural Audio Watermarking\n    summary: As generative audio models are rapidly evolving, AI-generated audios increasingly raise concerns about copyright infringement and misinformation spread. Audio watermarking, as a proactive defense, can embed secret messages into audio for copyright protection and source verification. However, current neural audio watermarking methods focus primarily on the imperceptibility and robustness of watermarking, while ignoring its vulnerability to security attacks. In this paper, we develop a simple yet powerful attack: the overwriting attack that overwrites the legitimate audio watermark with a forged one and makes the original legitimate watermark undetectable. Based on the audio watermarking information that the adversary has, we propose three categories of overwriting attacks, i.e., white-box, gray-box, and black-box attacks. We also thoroughly evaluate the proposed attacks on state-of-the-art neural audio watermarking methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed overwriting attacks can effectively compromise existing watermarking schemes across various settings and achieve a nearly 100% attack success rate. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed overwriting attacks expose security flaws in existing neural audio watermarking systems, underscoring the need to enhance security in future audio watermarking designs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05835v2\n    "}}

As organizations increasingly adopt platforms such as Microsoft Azure, this static defense model exposes cloud assets to zero-day exploits, botnets, and advanced persistent threats. In this paper, we introduce an automated defense framework that leverages medium- to high-interaction honeypot telemetry to dynamically update firewall rules in real time. The framework integrates deception sensors (Cowrie), Azure-native automation tools (Monitor, Sentinel, Logic Apps), and MITRE ATT&CK-aligned detection within a closed-loop feedback mechanism. We developed a testbed to automatically observe adversary tactics, classify them using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and mitigate network-level threats automatically with minimal human intervention.\n  To assess the framework's effectiveness, we defined and applied a set of attack- and defense-oriented security metrics. Building on existing adaptive defense strategies, our solution extends automated capabilities into cloud-native environments.

While the research community has made significant progress in WebShell detection (i.e., distinguishing malicious samples from benign ones), we argue that it is time to transition from passive detection to in-depth analysis and proactive defense. One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification. Our method begins with extracting dynamic function call traces to capture inherent behaviors that are resistant to common encryption and obfuscation. To enhance the scale and diversity of our dataset for a more stable evaluation, we augment these real-world traces with new variants synthesized by Large Language Models. These augmented traces are then abstracted into sequences, graphs, and trees, providing a foundation to benchmark a comprehensive suite of representation methods. Our evaluation spans classic sequence-based embeddings (CBOW, GloVe), transformers (BERT, SimCSE), and a range of structure-aware algorithms, including Graph Kernels, Graph Edit Distance, Graph2Vec, and various Graph Neural Networks. Through extensive experiments on four real-world, family-annotated datasets under both supervised and unsupervised settings, we establish a robust baseline and provide practical insights into the most effective combinations of data abstractions, representation models, and learning paradigms for this challenge.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05288v1\n    "}}

However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09114v2\n    "}}

Starting from a microscopic Lagrangian for a relativistic electron beam coupled to a single radiation mode, we construct a Keldysh functional integral, perform the large-N rescaling, and integrate out the electronic degrees of freedom. This yields an effective action for the FEL mode in which dispersion, gain, and noise are all generated by a single electronic self-energy built from the current correlations of the beam. For a stationary Gaussian beam, we obtain closed analytic expressions for the retarded and Keldysh components of the self-energy, which directly encode frequency pulling, gain reduction due to energy spread, and the noise spectrum experienced by the field. At low frequency, the theory reduces to a Landau-Ginzburg-Keldysh description of a single complex mode with a mass, growth rate, nonlinearity, and noise strength fully determined by beam current, energy spread, and detuning. In this framework, the FEL threshold appears as a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition in the laser universality class: the coherent field amplitude plays the role of an order parameter, while the amplitude of critical fluctuations is fixed by the microscopic noise kernel. The result is a minimal open quantum field theory analog of Vlasov-Maxwell FEL theory, in which gain, dispersion, and noise arise from a unified self-energy framework rather than from separate phenomenological ingredients.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05266v1\n    "}}

This paper designs the optimal task offloading policy to address the concerns involving processing delay, energy consumption and edge computing cost. Each computation task consisting of some interdependent sub-tasks is characterized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In such dynamic networks, a novel hierarchical Offloading scheme is proposed by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The inter-dependencies among the DAGs of the computation tasks are extracted using a graph neural network with attention mechanism. A parameterized DRL algorithm is developed to deal with the hierarchical action space containing both discrete and continuous actions. Simulation results with a real-world car speed dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the system overhead.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11352v2\n    "}}

The flexibility of edge computation is empowered by the deployment of lightweight container-based microservices. In this paper, we take the first step toward optimizing the microservice management in small-cell networks. The prominent feature is that each microservice consists of multiple image layers and different microservices may share some basic layers, thus bringing deep coupling in their placement and service provision. Our objective is to minimize the expected total latency of microservice requests under the storage, communication and computing constraints of the sparsely interconnected small cell nodes. We formulate a binary quadratic program (BQP) with the multi-dimensional strategy of the image layer placement, the access selection and the task assignment. The BQP problem is then transformed into an ILP problem, and is solved by use of a novel sphere-box alternating direction multipliers method (ADMM) with reasonable complexity $O(q^{4})$, where $q$ is the number of variables in the transformed problem. Trace-driven experiments show that the gap between our proposed algorithm and the optimal is reduced by 35$\\%$ compared with benchmark algorithms.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11359v2\n    "}}

These hardware bottlenecks confine quantum PDE solvers to low-fidelity regimes despite their theoretical potential for computational speedup. We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy. By bridging the gap between hardware-limited quantum simulations and application requirements, this work establishes a pathway for extracting computational value from current quantum devices in real-world scientific applications, advancing both algorithm development and practical deployment of near-term quantum computing for computational physics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05241v1\n    "}}

Yet these systems lack static guarantees about message protocols: processes communicate by sending arbitrary messages that pattern-matched at runtime, deferring protocol violations to production failures.\n  We present NVLang, a statically typed functional language that brings comprehensive type safety to the BEAM virtual machine while preserving actor model's simplicity and power. NVLang's central contribution that algebraic data types (ADTs) naturally encode actor message protocols: each actor declares the sum type representing its message vocabulary, and the type system enforces protocol conformance at compile time. We introduce typed process identifiers (Pid[T]) that encode the protocol an actor expects, and typed futures (Future[T]) that provide type-safe request-reply patterns.\n  By extending Hindley-Milner type inference to track message protocols, NVLang eliminates an entire class of message-passing errors while maintaining clean syntax that rivals dynamically typed alternatives. Our implementation compiles to Core Erlang, enabling seamless interoperability with the existing Erlang ecosystem. We formalize the type system and provide proof sketches for type soundness, demonstrating that well-typed NVLang programs cannot send messages that violate actor protocols.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05224v1\n    "}}

We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\\tt ibm\\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05210v1\n    "}}

Recently, VNE with Alternative topologies (VNEAP) was introduced to capture malleable VNRs, where each request can be instantiated using one of several functionally equivalent topologies that trade resources differently. While this flexibility enlarges the feasible space, it also introduces an additional decision layer, making dynamic embedding more challenging. This paper proposes HRL-VNEAP, a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for VNEAP under dynamic arrivals. A high-level policy selects the most suitable alternative topology (or rejects the request), and a low-level policy embeds the chosen topology onto the substrate network. Experiments on realistic substrate topologies under multiple traffic loads show that naive exploitation strategies provide only modest gains, whereas HRL-VNEAP consistently achieves the best performance across all metrics. Compared to the strongest tested baselines, HRL-VNEAP improves acceptance ratio by up to \\textbf{20.7\\%}, total revenue by up to \\textbf{36.2\\%}, and revenue-over-cost by up to \\textbf{22.1\\%}. Finally, we benchmark against an MILP formulation on tractable instances to quantify the remaining gap to optimality and motivate future work on learning- and optimization-based VNEAP solutions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05207v1\n    "}}

Live concerts, collaborative composition, and interactive experiences are driving the Musical Metaverse (MM), but the requirements of the underlying network and service infrastructures hinder its growth. These challenges underscore the need for a novel modeling and simulation paradigm tailored to the unique characteristics of MM sessions, along with specialized service provisioning strategies capable of capturing their interactive, heterogeneous, and multicast-oriented nature. To this end, we make a first attempt to formally model and analyze the problem of service provisioning for MM sessions in 5G/6G networks. We first formalize service and network graph models for the MM, using \"live audience interaction in a virtual concert\" as a reference scenario. We then present MuMeNet, a novel discrete-event network simulator specifically tailored to the requirements and the traffic dynamics of the MM. We showcase the effectiveness of MuMeNet by running a linear programming based orchestration policy on the reference scenario and providing performance analysis under realistic MM workloads.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05201v1\n    "}}

Specifically we show that for equilibrium properties of coupled light-matter systems, we can approximately capture the effects of multi-mode photonic environments on matter systems by either only keeping the polarization part of the electric field in the length-gauge formulation or by a few effective modes. We present a comprehensive set of approximation methods designed to accurately capture equilibrium phenomena in quantum light-matter systems across a range of complex photonic environments, from weak to strong coupling. These methods are applied to atomic and molecular models as well as to a two-dimensional quantum ring, demonstrating the versatility of our approach and laying the groundwork for first-principles simulations of real materials in cavity quantum electrodynamics.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05196v1\n    "}}
