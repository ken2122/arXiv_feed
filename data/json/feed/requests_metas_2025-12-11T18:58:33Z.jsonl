Our starting point is the complexity class $\\textsf{NBQP}$ (\"noisy BQP\"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10929v1\n    "}}

Inspired by peer-to-peer networks that leverage decentralized overlay nodes to increase throughput and availability, we propose GenTorrent, an LLM serving overlay that harnesses computing resources from decentralized contributors. We identify four key research problems inherent to enabling such a decentralized infrastructure: 1) overlay network organization; 2) LLM communication privacy; 3) overlay forwarding for resource efficiency; and 4) verification of serving quality. This work presents the first systematic study of these fundamental problems in the context of decentralized LLM serving. Evaluation results from a prototype implemented on a set of decentralized nodes demonstrate that GenTorrent achieves a latency reduction of over 50% compared to the baseline design without overlay forwarding. Furthermore, the security features introduce minimal overhead to serving latency and throughput. We believe this work pioneers a new direction for democratizing and scaling future AI serving capabilities.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20101v4\n    "}}

Let $X_\u03c0$ be the set of lines through the origin intersecting the slice $\u03c0\\cap S^{d-1}$, where $\u03c0=\\{x_d=\u03bb\\}$ and $S^{d-1}=\\{x:\\|x\\|=1\\}$. For $E\\subset\\mathbb{F}_q^{\\,d}$ and $N\\ge1$, we study the exceptional sets \\[ T_1(X_\u03c0,E,N)=\\bigl\\{V\\in X_\u03c0:\\ |\u03c0_V(E)|\\le N\\bigr\\},\\qquad T_2(X_\u03c0,E,N)=\\bigl\\{V\\in X_\u03c0:\\ |\u03c0_{V^\\perp}(E)|\\le N\\bigr\\}, \\] with their respective natural ranges of $N$. Using discrete Fourier analysis together with restriction/extension estimates for cone and sphere-type quadrics over finite fields, we obtain sharp upper bounds (up to constant factors) for $\\lvert T_1\\rvert$ and $\\lvert T_2\\rvert$, with separate analyses for the cases $\u03bb\\in \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$. The bounds exhibit arithmetic-geometric dichotomies absent in the full Grassmannian: the quadratic character of $\u03bb^{2}-1$ and the parity of $d$ determine the size of the exceptional sets.

However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10874v1\n    "}}

The framework allows administrators to express access control policies in plain language, which are then translated into vendor specific configurations. A compact schema bound intermediate representation separates human intent from device syntax and in the current prototype compiles to Palo Alto PAN OS command line configuration while remaining extensible to other platforms. Large language models are used only as assistive parsers that generate typed intermediate representation objects, while compilation and enforcement remain deterministic. The prototype integrates three validation layers, namely a static linter that checks structural and vendor specific constraints, a safety gate that blocks overly permissive rules such as any to any allows, and a Batfish based simulator that validates configuration syntax and referential integrity against a synthetic device model. The paper describes the architecture, implementation, and test methodology on synthetic network context datasets and discusses how this approach can evolve into a scalable auditable and human centered workflow for firewall policy management.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10789v1\n    "}}

The modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ parameterizes elliptic curves with $p$-torsion modules anti-symplectically isomorphic to $E[p]$. The work of Freitas--Naskr\u0119cki--Stoll uses the modular method to show that all primitive non-trivial solutions of the Fermat-type equation $x^2 + y^3 = z^p$ give rise to rational points on $X_E^-(p)$ with $E \\in \\{27a1,54a1,96a1,288a1,864a1,864b1,864c1 \\}$.

Furthermore, for each $E$ in the list and any $p$, we prove that either $X_E^-(p)$ can be discarded using the same criterion, or it cannot be discarded using purely local information.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10781v1\n    "}}

Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10755v1\n    "}}

However, in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX, the time source is outside the Trusted Computing Base: a malicious host can manipulate the TEE's notion of time, jumping in time or affecting perceived time speed. Previous work (Triad) proposes protocols for TEEs to maintain a trustworthy time source by building a cluster of TEEs that collaborate with each other and with a remote Time Authority to maintain a continuous notion of passing time. However, such approaches still allow an attacker to control the operating system and arbitrarily manipulate their own TEE's perceived clock speed. An attacker can even propagate faster passage of time to honest machines participating in Triad's trusted time protocol, causing them to skip to timestamps arbitrarily far in the future. We propose TriHaRd, a TEE trusted time protocol achieving high resilience against clock speed and offset manipulations, notably through Byzantine-resilient clock updates and consistency checks. We empirically show that TriHaRd mitigates known attacks against Triad.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10732v1\n    "}}

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v3\n    "}}

Previous work, MFC 3.0, was published, documented, and made open-source by Bryngelson et al. CPC (2021) features numerous physical features, numerical methods, and scalable infrastructure. MFC 5.0 is a significant update to MFC 3.0, featuring a broad set of well-established and novel physical models and numerical methods, as well as the introduction of GPU and APU (or superchip) acceleration. We exhibit state-of-the-art performance and ideal scaling on the first two exascale supercomputers, OLCF's Frontier and LLNL's El Capitan. Combined with MFC's single-accelerator performance, MFC achieves exascale computation in practice and has achieved the largest-to-date public CFD simulation at 200 trillion grid points, earning it a 2025 ACM Gordon Bell Prize finalist. New physical features include the immersed boundary method, $N$-fluid phase change, Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange sub-grid bubble models, fluid-structure interaction, hypo- and hyper-elastic materials, chemically reacting flow, two-material surface tension, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and more. Numerical techniques now represent the current state-of-the-art, including general relaxation characteristic boundary conditions, WENO variants, Strang splitting for stiff sub-grid flow features, and low Mach number treatments. Weak scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs on OLCF's Summit and Frontier, and LLNL's El Capitan, achieves efficiencies within 5% of ideal to over 90% of their respective system sizes. Strong scaling results for a 16-fold increase in device count show parallel efficiencies exceeding 90% on OLCF Frontier.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07953v4\n    "}}

Quantum networks will become the backbone of hybrid, quantum-augmented data centers, in which quantum algorithms are distributed over a local network of quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via shared entanglement. In this context, it is crucial to develop methods and software that minimize the number of inter-QPU communications. Here we describe key features of the quantum compiler araQne, which is designed to minimize distribution cost, measured by the number of entangled pairs required to distribute a monolithic quantum circuit using gate teleportation protocols. We establish the crucial role played by circuit reordering strategies, which strongly reduce the distribution cost compared to a baseline approach.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01090v2\n    "}}

However, they are associated with centralization and single-point-of-failure risks. This paper proposes Proof of Success and Reward Distribution (PSCRD), a novel multi-bridge response coordination and incentive distribution protocol designed to address the challenges. PSCRD introduces a fair reward distribution system that equitably distributes the transfer fee among participating bridges, incentivizing honest behavior and sustained commitment. The purpose is to encourage bridge participation for higher decentralization and lower single-point-of-failure risks. The mathematical analysis and simulation results validate the effectiveness of PSCRD using two key metrics: the Gini index, which demonstrates a progressive improvement in the fairness of the reward distribution as new bridge groups joined the network; and the Nakamoto coefficient, which shows a significant improvement in decentralization over time. These findings highlight that PSCRD provides a more resilient and secure cross-chain bridge system without substantially increasing user costs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10667v1\n    "}}

Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\u03bd=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\u03bd=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\u03bd=\\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12184v2\n    "}}

While virtual camera detection (VCD) has shown potential as a countermeasure, existing literature offers limited insight into its practical implementation and evaluation. This study introduces a machine learning-based approach to VCD, with a focus on its design and validation. The model is trained on metadata collected during sessions with authentic users.

Detecting such person-driven manipulations requires systems that not only distinguish altered content from authentic media but also provide clear and reliable reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects. TriDF provides a unified framework for understanding the interaction between detection accuracy, evidence identification, and explanation reliability, offering a foundation for building trustworthy systems that address real-world synthetic media threats.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10652v1\n    "}}

While traditional IDS approaches rely heavily on signature-based methods, they struggle to detect novel and evolving attacks. This paper presents an advanced IDS framework that leverages adversarial training and dynamic neural networks in 5G/6G networks to enhance network security by providing robust, real-time threat detection and response capabilities. Unlike conventional models, which require costly retraining to update knowledge, the proposed framework integrates incremental learning algorithms, reducing the need for frequent retraining. Adversarial training is used to fortify the IDS against poisoned data. By using fewer features and incorporating statistical properties, the system can efficiently detect potential threats. Extensive evaluations using the NSL- KDD dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach provides better accuracy of 82.33% for multiclass classification of various network attacks while resisting dataset poisoning. This research highlights the potential of adversarial-trained, dynamic neural networks for building resilient IDS solutions.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10637v1\n    "}}

Our central conclusion is the alignment of the objectives to concrete design elements as countermeasures, whereas certain objectives and countermeasures have no or minimal interferences with each other. For example, we work out that the integrity of a user's wallet and, accordingly, the prevention of double-spending race attacks should be addressed through the adoption and integration of \\textit{secure hardware} within a CBDC system.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10636v1\n    "}}

Existing protections, such as digital watermarking, are largely passive; they provide only post-hoc ownership verification and cannot actively prevent the illicit use of a stolen model. This work proposes a proactive protection scheme, dubbed ``Authority Backdoor,\" which embeds access constraints directly into the model. In particular, the scheme utilizes a backdoor learning framework to intrinsically lock a model's utility, such that it performs normally only in the presence of a specific trigger (e.g., a hardware fingerprint). But in its absence, the DNN's performance degrades to be useless. To further enhance the security of the proposed authority scheme, the certifiable robustness is integrated to prevent an adaptive attacker from removing the implanted backdoor. The resulting framework establishes a secure authority mechanism for DNNs, combining access control with certifiable robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on diverse architectures and datasets validate the effectiveness and certifiable robustness of the proposed framework.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10600v1\n    "}}

We present a lightweight, training-free approach for detecting synthetic speech and attributing it to its source model. Our method addresses three tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting, (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world setting, and (3) real vs. synthetic speech classification. The core idea is simple: we compute standardized average residuals--the difference between an audio signal and its filtered version--to extract model-agnostic fingerprints that capture synthesis artifacts. Experiments across multiple synthesis systems and languages show AUROC scores above 99%, with strong reliability even when only a subset of model outputs is available. The method maintains high performance under common audio distortions, including echo and moderate background noise, while data augmentation can improve results in more challenging conditions. In addition, out-of-domain detection is performed using Mahalanobis distances to in-domain residual fingerprints, achieving an F1 score of 0.91 on unseen models, reinforcing the method's efficiency, generalizability, and suitability for digital forensics and security applications.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013v4\n    "}}

Although the overall throughput has improved greatly, the Decode-stage of PD disaggregation remains to be a major bottleneck. This bottleneck primarily stems from the conflict between linear growth of Latent-Cache with sequence length and the limited GPU memory capacity, which constrains the feasible batch-size and thereby suppresses Decode-stage throughput.\n  To address this challenge, we propose ESS (Extended Sparse Server), an offload-centric system design tailored for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. ESS selectively offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while preserving latency-critical components on GPU. By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints. This design significantly improves Decode-stage throughput, thereby reducing deployment costs in real-world settings.\n  Our high-fidelity simulations show that ESS delivers 69.4\\% throughput improvement at 32K context length and up to 123\\% throughput improvement at 128K, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-context inference workloads. These results highlight ESS as a practical and scalable solution for long-context LLM serving.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10576v1\n    "}}

This work presents the first coherent quantum circuit for simulating an M/G/1/K queue under arbitrary service-time laws. The circuit encodes the service distribution through a logarithmic-depth ladder of $R_y$ rotations and enforces buffer constraints via a comparator-controlled phase gate, while preserving the quadratic speed-up of amplitude amplification. Grover iterations center on estimating the expected number of customers in the system, yielding provable $O(\\sqrt{N})$ variance reduction and closed-form confidence bounds, where $N$ denotes the number of shots. Empirical evaluations on IBM quantum simulators across four service distributions and three traffic intensities demonstrate fidelity above 0.99 with four qubits and above 0.76 with ten qubits, with Jensen-Shannon divergence below 0.11. Waiting-time estimation errors decrease by an order of magnitude as system load approaches capacity and remain within 3% in high-traffic regimes using registers of up to 63 qubits. These results establish the first end-to-end quantum simulation framework for finite-buffer, non-Markovian queueing systems and provide a concrete foundation for quantum-accelerated performance analysis in service-oriented architectures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10558v1\n    "}}

Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps. However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10537v3\n    "}}

One way to address these threats is through hands-on exercises that bridge IT and OT domains to improve defensive readiness. However, consistently evaluating whether a CR platform is suitable and effective remains a challenge. This paper proposes an evaluation framework for CRs, emphasizing mission-critical settings by using a multi-criteria decision-making approach. We define a set of evaluation criteria that capture technical fidelity, training and assessment capabilities, scalability, usability, and other relevant factors. To weight and aggregate these criteria, we employ the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), supported by a simulated panel of multidisciplinary experts implemented through a Large Language Model (LLM). This LLM-assisted expert reasoning enables consistent and reproducible pairwise comparisons across criteria without requiring direct expert convening. The framework's output equals quantitative scores that facilitate objective comparison of CR platforms and highlight areas for improvement. Overall, this work lays the foundation for a standardized and explainable evaluation methodology to guide both providers and end-users of CRs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10487v1\n    "}}

Recent work suggests that both graph neural network (GNN)-based and transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), yield promising results when evaluated on curated benchmark datasets. These datasets are typically characterized by consistent data distributions and heuristic or partially noisy labels. In this study, we systematically evaluate two representative DL models-ReVeal and LineVul-across four representative datasets: Juliet, Devign, BigVul, and ICVul. Each model is trained independently on each respective dataset, and their code representations are analyzed using t-SNE to uncover vulnerability related patterns. To assess realistic applicability, we deploy these models along with four pretrained LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-o3-mini, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 on a curated dataset, VentiVul, comprising 20 recently (May 2025) fixed vulnerabilities from the Linux kernel. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle to distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable code in representation space and generalize poorly across datasets with differing distributions. When evaluated on VentiVul, our newly constructed time-wise out-of-distribution dataset, performance drops sharply, with most models failing to detect vulnerabilities reliably. These results expose a persistent gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment, emphasizing the value of our deployment-oriented evaluation framework and the need for more robust code representations and higher-quality datasets.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10485v1\n    "}}

Rogue Access Point attacks, specifically the Evil Twin variant, enable attackers to clone legitimate wireless network identifiers to deceive users into connecting. Once a connection is established, the adversary can intercept traffic and harvest sensitive credentials. While modern defensive architectures often employ Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to identify malicious activity, the effectiveness of these systems against Layer 2 wireless threats remains a subject of critical inquiry. This project aimed to design a stealth-capable Rogue AP and evaluate its detectability against Suricata, an open-source NIDS/IPS. The methodology initially focused on a hardware-based deployment using Raspberry Pi platforms but transitioned to a virtualized environment due to severe system compatibility issues. Using Wifipumpkin3, the research team successfully deployed a captive portal that harvested user credentials from connected devices. However, the Suricata NIDS failed to flag the attack, highlighting a significant blind spot in traditional intrusion detection regarding wireless management frame attacks. This paper details the construction of the attack, the evasion techniques employed, and the limitations of current NIDS solutions in detecting localized wireless threats\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10470v1\n    "}}

This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the \"Lazy Reviewer\" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping \"Reject\" decisions to \"Accept,\" for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like \"Maximum Mark Magyk\" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models.

By clustering clients and training cluster-specific models, CFL enables personalized models tailored to groups of heterogeneous clients. However, conventional CFL approaches suffer from fragmented learning for training independent global models for each cluster and fail to take advantage of collective cluster insights. This paper advocates a shift to hierarchical CFL, allowing bi-level aggregation to train cluster-specific models at the edge and a unified global model at the cloud. This shift improves training efficiency yet might introduce communication challenges. To this end, we propose CFLHKD, a novel personalization scheme for integrating hierarchical cluster knowledge into CFL. Built upon multi-teacher knowledge distillation, CFLHKD enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing while preserving cluster-specific personalization. CFLHKD adopts a bi-level aggregation to bridge the gap between local and global learning. Extensive evaluations of standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFLHKD outperforms representative baselines in cluster-specific and global model accuracy and achieves a performance improvement of 3.32-7.57\\%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10443v1\n    "}}

Internet of Things and Cloud computing integrated systems (IoT-Cloud) facilitate sensing, automation, and processing for these healthcare applications. While real-time response is crucial for alleviating patient emergencies, protecting patient privacy is extremely important in data-driven healthcare. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer IoT, Edge and Cloud architecture to enhance the speed of response for emergency healthcare by distributing tasks based on response criticality and permanence of storage. Privacy of patient data is assured by proposing a Differential Privacy framework across several machine learning models such as K-means, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. We establish a comprehensive threat model identifying three adversary classes and evaluate Laplace, Gaussian, and hybrid noise mechanisms across varying privacy budgets, with supervised algorithms achieving up to 86% accuracy. The proposed hybrid Laplace-Gaussian noise mechanism with adaptive budget allocation provides a balanced approach, offering moderate tails and better privacy-utility trade-offs for both low and high dimension datasets. At the practical threshold of $\\varepsilon = 5.0$, supervised algorithms achieve 82-84% accuracy while reducing attribute inference attacks by up to 18% and data reconstruction correlation by 70%.

However, existing Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) exhibit structural limitations in this setting: inflated local groups increase single-node repair cost, multi-node failures frequently trigger expensive global repair, and reliability degrades sharply. We identify a key root cause: local and global parity blocks are designed independently, preventing them from cooperating during repair. We present Cascaded Parity LRCs (CP-LRCs), a new family of wide stripe LRCs that embed structured dependency between parity blocks by decomposing a global parity block across all local parity blocks. This creates a cascaded parity group that preserves MDS-level fault tolerance while enabling low-bandwidth single-node and multi-node repairs. We provide a general coefficient-generation framework, develop repair algorithms exploiting cascading, and instantiate the design with CP-Azure and CP-Uniform. Evaluations on Alibaba Cloud show reductions in repair time of up to 41% for single-node failures and 26% for two-node failures.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10425v1\n    "}}

To this aim, we first derive the weight enumerator (WE) for the undetectable errors based on the quantum MacWilliams identities. The WE is then used to evaluate tight upper bounds on the error rate of CSS quantum codes with \\acl{MW} decoding. For surface codes we also derive a simple closed form expression of the bounds over the depolarizing channel. We introduce a novel approach that combines the knowledge of WE with a logical operator analysis, allowing the derivation of the exact asymptotic error rate for short codes. For example, on a depolarizing channel with physical error rate $\u03c1\\to 0$, the logical error rate $\u03c1_\\mathrm{L}$ is asymptotically $\u03c1_\\mathrm{L} \\approx 16 \u03c1^2$ for the $[[9,1,3]]$ Shor code, $\u03c1_\\mathrm{L} \\approx 16.3 \u03c1^2$ for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code, $\u03c1_\\mathrm{L} \\approx 18.7 \u03c1^2$ for the $[[13,1,3]]$ surface code, and $\u03c1_\\mathrm{L} \\approx 149.3 \u03c1^3$ for the $[[41,1,5]]$ surface code. For larger codes our bound provides $\u03c1_\\mathrm{L} \\approx 1215 \u03c1^4$ and $\u03c1_\\mathrm{L} \\approx 663 \u03c1^5$ for the $[[85,1,7]]$ and the $[[181,1,10]]$ surface codes, respectively. Finally, we extend our analysis to include realistic, noisy syndrome extraction circuits by modeling error propagation throughout gadgets. This enables estimation of logical error rates under faulty measurements. The performance analysis serves as a design tool for developing fault-tolerant quantum systems by guiding the selection of quantum codes based on their error correction capability. Additionally, it offers a novel perspective on quantum degeneracy, showing it represents the fraction of non-correctable error patterns shared by multiple logical operators.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01301v4\n    "}}

However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks such as Denial of Service (DoS). Recent advancements in the large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful capabilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel defense architecture that proactively mitigates various DoS threats in cloud networks. LLM-PD can efficiently make decisions through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically create and deploy actionable defense mechanisms. Furthermore, it can flexibly self-evolve based on experience learned from previous interactions and adapt to new attack scenarios without additional training. Our case study on three distinct DoS attacks demonstrates its remarkable ability in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency when compared with other existing methods.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21051v4\n    "}}

Existing approaches, including federated learning (FL) and blockchain-based data markets, fall short: FL often depends on trusted aggregators and lacks Byzantine robustness, while blockchain frameworks struggle with computation-intensive training and incentive integration.\n  We present \\prot, a decentralized data marketplace that unifies federated learning, blockchain arbitration, and economic incentives into a single framework for privacy-preserving data sharing. \\prot\\ enables data buyers to submit bid-based requests via blockchain smart contracts, which manage auctions, escrow, and dispute resolution. Computationally intensive training is delegated to \\cone\\ (\\uline{Co}mpute \\uline{N}etwork for \\uline{E}xecution), an off-chain distributed execution layer. To safeguard against adversarial behavior, \\prot\\ integrates a modified YODA protocol with exponentially growing execution sets for resilient consensus, and introduces Corrected OSMD to mitigate malicious or low-quality contributions from sellers. All protocols are incentive-compatible, and our game-theoretic analysis establishes honesty as the dominant strategy.\n  We implement \\prot\\ on Ethereum and evaluate it over benchmark datasets -- MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 -- under varying adversarial settings. \\prot\\ achieves up to 99\\% accuracy on MNIST and 90\\% on Fashion-MNIST, with less than 3\\% degradation up to 30\\% Byzantine nodes, and 56\\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 despite its complexity.

However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers will need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks through normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions. We also present a mitigation strategy to defend against co-location attacks in serverless clouds. Our work highlights critical areas for security enhancements in current cloud schedulers, offering insights to fortify serverless computing environments against potential co-location attacks.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10361v1\n    "}}

These include latency-sensitive requests emphasizing per-token latency in streaming chat, deadline-sensitive requests requiring rapid full responses to trigger external tools, and compound requests with evolving dependencies across multiple LLM calls. Despite-or perhaps, because of-this workload diversity and unpredictable request information (e.g., response lengths and dependencies), existing request schedulers have focused on aggregate performance, unable to ensure application-level SLO needs.\n  This paper presents JITServe, the first SLO-aware LLM serving system designed to maximize service goodput (e.g., the number of tokens meeting request SLOs) across diverse workloads. JITServe novelly schedules requests using imprecise request information and gradually relaxes this conservatism by refining request information estimates as generation progresses. It applies a grouped margin goodput maximization algorithm to allocate just enough serving bandwidth to satisfy each request's SLO just-in-time (JIT), maximizing residual capacity for others, while deciding the composition of requests in a batch to maximize efficiency and goodput with provable guarantees. Our evaluation across diverse realistic workloads, including chat, deep research, and agentic pipelines, shows that JITServe improves service goodput by 1.4x-6.3x, alternatively achieving 28.5%-83.2% resource savings, compared to state-of-the-art designs.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20068v2\n    "}}

Switches need to handle parallel input and output streams from each port, prioritizing throughput, efficiency, and packet integrity. Due to the confidential nature of the networking device industry, there do not exist many open source implementations of switching fabrics.

However, FL remains susceptible to privacy threats that can compromise data via direct means. That said, indirectly compromising the confidentiality of the FL model architecture (e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN)) on a client device by an outsider remains unexplored. If leaked, this information can enable next-level attacks tailored to the architecture. This paper proposes a novel side-channel fingerprinting attack, leveraging flow-level and packet-level statistics of encrypted wireless traffic from an FL client to infer its deep learning model architecture. We name it FLARE, a fingerprinting framework based on FL Architecture REconnaissance. Evaluation across various CNN and RNN variants-including pre-trained and custom models trained over IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi-shows that FLARE achieves over 98% F1-score in closed-world and up to 91% in open-world scenarios. These results reveal that CNN and RNN models leak distinguishable traffic patterns, enabling architecture fingerprinting even under realistic FL settings with hardware, software, and data heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this is the first work to fingerprint FL model architectures by sniffing encrypted wireless traffic, exposing a critical side-channel vulnerability in current FL systems.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10296v1\n    "}}

To this end, we propose ACORN, an end-to-end system that automates the distributed deployment of practical machine learning models across the network. ACORN provides a fully automated pipeline that loads and deploys Python ML models on network devices using an optimized deployment plan from an ILP planner. To support larger models under hardware constraints and allow runtime programmability, ACORN adopts a novel data plane representation for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models. We implement ACORN prototype in P4 and run it on real programmable hardware. Our evaluation shows ACORN can deploy classification ML models with 2-4x more features than state-of-the-art solutions, while imposing negligible overhead on network performance and traffic. We will make our data plane program, model translator, optimizer, and all related scripts publicly available.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09809v2\n    "}}

Traditional rule based or signature driven detection systems are often inadequate in identifying novel or evolving threats within Identity and Access Management logs, where anomalous behavior may appear statistically benign but contextually malicious. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network Based Adaptive Threat Detection framework designed to learn latent user resource interaction patterns from IAM audit trails in real time. By modeling IAM logs as heterogeneous dynamic graphs, the proposed system captures temporal, relational, and contextual dependencies across entities such as users, roles, sessions, and access actions. The model incorporates attention based aggregation and graph embedding updates to enable continual adaptation to changing cloud environments. Experimental evaluation on synthesized and real world IAM datasets demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher detection precision and recall than baseline LSTM and GCN classifiers, while maintaining scalability across multi tenant cloud environments. The frameworks adaptability enables proactive mitigation of insider threats, privilege escalation, and lateral movement attacks, contributing to the foundation of AI driven zero trust access analytics. This work bridges the gap between graph based machine learning and operational cloud security intelligence.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10280v1\n    "}}

However, the growing heterogeneity of GPU clusters and limited visibility into application characteristics pose major challenges for existing schedulers, which often rely on offline profiling or application-specific assumptions. We present RLTune, an application-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling framework that dynamically prioritizes and allocates DL jobs on heterogeneous GPU clusters. RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent. Unlike prior approaches, RLTune generalizes across diverse workloads without requiring per-job profiling, making it practical for cloud providers to deploy at scale for more efficient, fair, and sustainable DL workload management.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10271v1\n    "}}

However, applying them to arbitrary functions (especially internal functions) \\textit{at scale} remains challenging due to the requirement of sophisticated contextual information, such as specification, dependencies, and usage examples. State-of-the-art methods heavily rely on static or incomplete context provisioning, causing failure of generating functional harnesses. Furthermore, LLMs tend to exploit harness validation metrics, producing plausible yet logically useless code. % Therefore, harness generation across large and diverse projects continues to face challenges in reliable compilation, robust code retrieval, and comprehensive validation.\n  To address these challenges, we present HarnessAgent, a tool-augmented agentic framework that achieves fully automated, scalable harness construction over hundreds of OSS-Fuzz targets. HarnessAgent introduces three key innovations: 1) a rule-based strategy to identify and minimize various compilation errors; 2) a hybrid tool pool for precise and robust symbol source code retrieval; and 3) an enhanced harness validation pipeline that detects fake definitions. We evaluate HarnessAgent on 243 target functions from OSS-Fuzz projects (65 C projects and 178 C++ projects). It improves the three-shot success rate by approximately 20\\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 87\\% for C and 81\\% for C++. Our one-hour fuzzing results show that more than 75\\% of the harnesses generated by HarnessAgent increase the target function coverage, surpassing the baselines by over 10\\%. In addition, the hybrid tool-pool system of HarnessAgent achieves a response rate of over 90\\% for source code retrieval, outperforming Fuzz Introspector by more than 30\\%.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03420v3\n    "}}

However, LLM-empowered applications are vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where instructions are injected via untrustworthy external data sources. This paper presents Rennervate, a defense framework to detect and prevent IPI attacks. Rennervate leverages attention features to detect the covert injection at a fine-grained token level, enabling precise sanitization that neutralizes IPI attacks while maintaining LLM functionalities. Specifically, the token-level detector is materialized with a 2-step attentive pooling mechanism, which aggregates attention heads and response tokens for IPI detection and sanitization. Moreover, we establish a fine-grained IPI dataset, FIPI, to be open-sourced to support further research. Extensive experiments verify that Rennervate outperforms 15 commercial and academic IPI defense methods, achieving high precision on 5 LLMs and 6 datasets. We also demonstrate that Rennervate is transferable to unseen attacks and robust against adaptive adversaries.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08417v2\n    "}}

With such techniques, there is a high prevalence of data-dependent communication and computation operations where communication is exposed, leaving as high as 1.7x ideal performance on the table. Prior works harness the fact that ML model state and inputs are already sharded, and employ careful overlap of individual computation/communication shards. While such coarse-grain overlap is promising, in this work, we instead make a case for finer-grain compute-communication overlap which we term FiCCO, where we argue for finer-granularity, one-level deeper overlap than at shard-level, to unlock compute/communication overlap for a wider set of network topologies, finer-grain dataflow and more. We show that FiCCO opens up a wider design space of execution schedules than possible at shard-level alone. At the same time, decomposition of ML operations into smaller operations (done in both shard-based and finer-grain techniques) causes operation-level inefficiency losses. To balance the two, we first present a detailed characterization of these inefficiency losses, then present a design space of FiCCO schedules, and finally overlay the schedules with concomitant inefficiency signatures. Doing so helps us design heuristics that frameworks and runtimes can harness to select bespoke FiCCO schedules based on the nature of underlying ML operations. Finally, to further minimize contention inefficiencies inherent with operation overlap, we offload communication to GPU DMA engines. We evaluate several scenarios from realistic ML deployments and demonstrate that our proposed bespoke schedules deliver up to 1.6x speedup and our heuristics provide accurate guidance in 81% of unseen scenarios.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10236v1\n    "}}

Many defense methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, traditional poisoning attacks are not as threatening as commonly believed. This is because they often cause differences in how the model performs on the training set compared to the validation set. Such inconsistency can alert defenders that their data has been poisoned, allowing them to take the necessary defensive actions. In this paper, we introduce a more threatening type of poisoning attack called the Deferred Poisoning Attack. This new attack allows the model to function normally during the training and validation phases but makes it very sensitive to evasion attacks or even natural noise. We achieve this by ensuring the poisoned model's loss function has a similar value as a normally trained model at each input sample but with a large local curvature. A similar model loss ensures that there is no obvious inconsistency between the training and validation accuracy, demonstrating high stealthiness. On the other hand, the large curvature implies that a small perturbation may cause a significant increase in model loss, leading to substantial performance degradation, which reflects a worse robustness. We fulfill this purpose by making the model have singular Hessian information at the optimal point via our proposed Singularization Regularization term. We have conducted both theoretical and empirical analyses of the proposed method and validated its effectiveness through experiments on image classification tasks. Furthermore, we have confirmed the hazards of this form of poisoning attack under more general scenarios using natural noise, offering a new perspective for research in the field of security.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03752v3\n    "}}

Motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that self-interacting ultralight axions can be captured by the Sun's gravitational field and thermalize into the ground state, we develop a signal model for the pseudo-magnetic fields generated by axion-proton gradient couplings in such a halo. The analysis focuses on the fifth GNOME Science Run (69 days, 12 stations), employing a cross-correlation pipeline with time-shifted daily modulation templates to search for the global, direction-dependent, monochromatic signal expected from a solar axion halo. No statistically significant candidate signals are observed. We set 95% confidence-level upper limits on the amplitude of the axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field over the frequency range 0.05 Hz to 20 Hz, translating to constraints on the linear and quadratic axion-proton couplings for halo densities predicted by gravitational capture models and for the maximum overdensities allowed by planetary ephemerides. In the quadratic coupling case, our limits surpass existing astrophysical bounds by over two orders of magnitude across much of the accessible parameter space.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10221v1\n    "}}

Using these bounds, we prove a sharp contrast: strategyproofness in the large holds if and only if each principal's share of identities vanishes, whereas any principal with a persistent positive share can construct deviations yielding strictly positive limiting gains. We further show that the feasibility of BRACE fails in the event of an unbounded population of Sybils and provide a precise cost threshold that ensures disincentivization of such attacks in large markets.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10203v1\n    "}}

In parallel, recent research has focused on undetectability, a property ensuring that watermarks remain difficult for adversaries to detect and spoof. In this work, we introduce a new class of watermarking schemes constructed through probabilistic automata. We present two instantiations: (i) a practical scheme with exponential generation diversity and computational efficiency, and (ii) a theoretical construction with formal undetectability guarantees under cryptographic assumptions.

However, electronic structure simulations based on density functional theory fail to predict experimental results if correlations are not properly accounted for. Here, we report a sample-based quantum diagonalization workflow for simulating electronic states of periodic materials, and for predicting their band gaps. To that end, we devise a general lattice Hamiltonian representation in which material-specific, electronic interaction parameters are obtained self-consistently. Two exemplar, wide-gap materials - hafnium dioxide and zirconium dioxide - are expressed as quantum circuits that leverage the lattice representation with a materials-specific parametrization. We sample the quantum circuits on a state-of-the-art, superconducting quantum processor and diagonalize the lattice Hamiltonian in the reduced configuration subspaces with standard techniques. Our method outperforms select quantum-chemical benchmarks as well as approaches based on density functional theory, the standard reference in materials simulation of solids. Importantly, the quantum-computed band gap predictions for the two dielectrics agree with independent lab experiments. In essence, quantum-classical hybrid simulation workflows on pre-fault tolerant quantum computers produce useful, experimentally verifiable property predictions in applied materials science.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10901v2\n    "}}

We focus on a realistic scenario where external vendors access their hardware in our 5G factory network, posing recurrent security risks from untrusted gNBs and intermediate network elements. Unlike prior studies limited to lab setups, we implement a complete proof-of-concept in a factory environment and compare WireGuard with IPsec under industrial traffic conditions. Our approach successfully protects user data (N3 interface) against untrusted gNBs and man-in-the-middle attacks while enabling control plane (N2 interface) authentication between the access and mobility management functions (AMF) and gNB. Performance measurements show that WireGuard adds minimal overhead in throughput, latency, and Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage, achieving performance comparable to IPsec. These findings demonstrate that WireGuard offers competitive performance with significantly reduced configuration complexity, making it a strong candidate for broader adoption in O-RAN, providing a unified, lightweight security layer across multiple interfaces and components.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10135v1\n    "}}

An attacker controlling an inference server may exfiltrate model weights by hiding them within ordinary model outputs, a strategy known as steganography. This work investigates how to verify model responses to defend against such attacks and, more broadly, to detect anomalous or buggy behavior during inference. We formalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification framework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify the trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we characterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference and introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection framework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On MOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to <0.5% with false-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a >200x slowdown for adversaries. Overall, this work further establishes a foundation for defending against model weight exfiltration and demonstrates that strong protection can be achieved with minimal additional cost to inference providers.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02620v2\n    "}}

As systems increasingly deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) applications, these systems face evolving phishing email threats that exploit their fundamental architectures. Current LLMs require substantial hardening before deployment in email security systems, particularly against coordinated multi-vector attacks that exploit architectural vulnerabilities. This paper proposes LLMPEA, an LLM-based framework to detect phishing email attacks across multiple attack vectors, including prompt injection, text refinement, and multilingual attacks. We evaluate three frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Grok-3) and comprehensive prompting design to assess their feasibility, robustness, and limitations against phishing email attacks. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs can detect the phishing email over 90% accuracy while we also highlight that LLM-based phishing email detection systems could be exploited by adversarial attack, prompt injection, and multilingual attacks. Our findings provide critical insights for LLM-based phishing detection in real-world settings where attackers exploit multiple vulnerabilities in combination.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10104v1\n    "}}

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) serves as the primary public transportation system in the Greater Boston Area, with the Green Line representing one of the oldest and most complex rapid transit systems in the network. This paper presents a network-based risk and resilience assessment of the MBTA Green Line using graph theory, network metrics, and the Model-Based Risk Analysis (MBRA) tool. The original 70-station Green Line network is simplified into a 17-node model, and key metrics, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, spectral radius, node robustness, and blocking nodes, are computed using Python-based analysis. Critical vulnerability is derived using the MBRA resiliency equation, and random, targeted, and cyber-physical attack scenarios are evaluated. The results identify North Station, Government Center, Haymarket, Copley, and Kenmore as the most critical nodes. A fault tree analysis between Kenmore and Copley further demonstrates the impact of budget allocation on threat reduction.

One aspect is that users have to compose command lines to adapt to the heterogeneous launchers, schedulers, affinity options, DL framework arguments, and environment variables. Composing correct command lines is error-prone and can easily frustrate users, impeding research or wasting resources. In this work, we present Maple, a multi-agent system that generates correct DL command lines with users' natural language input. Maple consists of four agents with the functionalities of information extraction, template retrieval, command line verification, and error correction. We evaluate Maple on nine GPU clusters across national computing centers in the U.S., five representative deep learning model families, and four commonly used parallel DL training paradigms. Our experiments also cover schedulers of SLURM and PBS and heterogeneous architectures, such as NVIDIA A100/H200 GPUs and Intel Max series GPUs. Maple achieves 92.0% accuracy in generating command lines across the 567 test cases. Leverage multiple language models with an aggregated size of 10B parameters, Maple delivers comparable performance to the state-of-the-art models of GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini. Together, these results highlight Maple's practical value in enabling portable and scalable distributed DL across heterogeneous HPC environments.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08842v2\n    "}}

Cybercriminals are exploiting this trend, deploying malicious Chrome extensions posing as AI tools or impersonating popular GenAI models to target users. These extensions often appear legitimate while secretly exfiltrating sensitive data or redirecting users web traffic to attacker-controlled domains.\n  To examine the impact of this trend on the browser extension ecosystem, we curated a dataset of 5,551 AI-themed extensions released over a nine-month period to the Chrome Web Store. Using a multi-signal detection methodology that combines manifest analysis, domain reputation, and runtime network behavior, supplemented with human review, we identified 154 previously undetected malicious Chrome extensions. Together with extensions known from public threat research disclosures, this resulted in a final set of 341 malicious extensions for analysis. Of these, 29 were GenAI-related, forming the focus of our in-depth analysis and disclosure.\n  We deconstruct representative GenAI cases, including Supersonic AI, DeepSeek AI | Free AI Assistant, and Perplexity Search, to illustrate attacker techniques such as Adversary-in-the-Browser, impersonation, bait-and-switch updates, query hijacking, and redirection. Our findings show that threat actors are leveraging GenAI trends and exploiting browser extension APIs and settings for malicious purposes. This demonstrates that the browser extension threat landscape is directly evolving alongside the rapid adoption of GenAI technologies.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10029v1\n    "}}

As a corollary, we obtain that, under WSC, two totally real number fields have the same regulator if and only if they have the same class number and Dedekind zeta function. We also prove that, under WSC, the isometry and similarity classes of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field of degree $[K:\\Q]\\geq 4$, characterize the isomorphism class of said field. All of our results follow from establishing that, under WSC, any Gram matrix of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field yields a generic point of certain closed irreducible $\\Q$-subvariety of the space of symmetric matrices of appropriate size.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03432v2\n    "}}

While their theoretical foundations are well studied, practical performance under real-world conditions remains less understood.\n  In this work, we present a systematic, implementation-level comparison of zk-SNARKs (Groth16) and zk-STARKs using publicly available reference implementations on a consumer-grade ARM platform. Our empirical evaluation covers proof generation time, verification latency, proof size, and CPU profiling. Results show that zk-SNARKs generate proofs 68x faster with 123x smaller proof size, but verify slower and require trusted setup, whereas zk-STARKs, despite larger proofs and slower generation, verify faster and remain transparent and post-quantum secure. Profiling further identifies distinct computational bottlenecks across the two systems, underscoring how execution models and implementation details significantly affect real-world performance. These findings provide actionable insights for developers, protocol designers, and researchers in selecting and optimizing proof systems for applications such as privacy-preserving transactions, verifiable computation, and scalable rollups.\n    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10020v1\n    "}}
